Projected Changes in Deaths in U.S. Cities by Season
Outdoor workers spend a great deal of time exposed to 
temperature extremes, often while performing vigorous 
activities.
This figure shows the projected increase in deaths due to warming in the summer 
months (hot season, April–September), the projected decrease in deaths due to 
warming in the winter months (cold season, October–March), and the projected net 
change in deaths compared to a 1990 baseline period for the 209 U.S. cities examined, 
using the GFDL–CM3 and MIROC5 climate models (see Ch. 2: Temperature-Related 
Deaths and Illness). (Figure source: adapted from Schwartz et al. 2015)2
Changing Tolerance to Extreme Heat
Key Finding 3: An increase in population tolerance 
to extreme heat has been observed over time 
[Very High Confidence]. Changes in this tolerance 
have been associated with increased use of air 
conditioning, improved social responses, and/or 
physiological acclimatization, among other factors 
[Medium Confidence]. Expected future increases 
in this tolerance will reduce the projected increase 
in deaths from heat [Very Likely, Very High 
Confidence].
Some Populations at Greater Risk
Key Finding 4: Older adults and children have a 
higher risk of dying or becoming ill due to extreme 
heat [Very High Confidence]. People working 
outdoors, the socially isolated and economically 
disadvantaged, those with chronic illnesses, 
as well as some communities of color, are also 
especially vulnerable to death or illness [Very High 
Confidence].

Ragweed pollen frequently triggers hay fever 
and asthma episodes during the fall.
Changes in the climate affect the air we breathe, both indoors 
and outdoors. The changing climate has modified weather pat­
terns, which in turn have influenced the levels and location of 
outdoor air pollutants such as ground-level ozone (O3) and fine 
particulate matter. Increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels also 
promote the growth of plants that release airborne allergens 
(aeroallergens). Finally, these changes to outdoor air quality and 
aeroallergens also affect indoor air quality as both pollutants and 
aeroallergens infiltrate homes, schools, and other buildings. Poor 
air quality, whether outdoors or indoors, can negatively affect 
the human respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Higher pollen 
concentrations and longer pollen seasons can increase allergic 
sensitization and asthma episodes and thereby limit productivity 
at work and school. 
The air quality response to climate change can vary substantially by region across scenarios. Two downscaled global climate 
model projections using two greenhouse gas concentration pathways estimate increases in average daily maximum temperatures 
of 1.8°F to 7.2°F (1°C to 4°C) and increases of 1 to 5 parts per billion (ppb) in daily 8-hour maximum ozone in the year 2030 
relative to the year 2000 throughout the continental United States. Unless reductions in ozone precursor emissions offset the 
influence of climate change, this “climate penalty” of increased ozone concentrations due to climate change would result in tens 
to thousands of additional ozone-related premature deaths per year, shown here as incidences per year by county (see Ch. 3: 
Air Quality Impacts).  (Figure source: adapted from Fann et al. 2015)3

(Top) Dampness and mold in U.S. homes are linked to approximately 4.6 million cases of worsened asthma. (Left) Wildfires 
are a major source of airborne particulate matter, especially in the western United States during summer. Climate change has 
already led to an increased frequency of large wildfires, as well as longer durations of individual wildfires and longer wildfire 
seasons in the western United States. (Right) Nearly 6.8 million children in the United States are affected by asthma, making it 
a major chronic disease of childhood. 
Exacerbated Ozone Health Impacts 
Key Finding 1: Climate change will make it harder 
for any given regulatory approach to reduce ground-
level ozone pollution in the future as meteorological 
conditions become increasingly conducive to forming 
ozone over most of the United States [Likely, High 
Confidence]. Unless offset by additional emissions 
reductions of ozone precursors, these climate-driven 
increases in ozone will cause premature deaths, 
hospital visits, lost school days, and acute respiratory 
symptoms [Likely, High Confidence].
Increased Health Impacts from Wildfires
Key Finding 2: Wildfires emit fine particles and ozone 
precursors that in turn increase the risk of premature 
death and adverse chronic and acute cardiovascular 
and respiratory health outcomes [Likely, High 
Confidence]. Climate change is projected to increase 
the number and severity of naturally occurring wildfires 
in parts of the United States, increasing emissions of 
particulate matter and ozone precursors and resulting 
in additional adverse health outcomes [Likely, High 
Confidence].  
Worsened Allergy and Asthma Conditions 
Key Finding 3: Changes in climate, specifically rising 
temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and 
increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide, are expected to contribute to increases in 
the levels of some airborne allergens and associated 
increases in asthma episodes and other allergic 
illnesses [High Confidence].

Climate change projections show that there will 
be continuing increases in the occurrence and 
severity of some extreme events by the end of the 
century, while for other extremes the links to cli­
mate change are more uncertain. Some regions of 
the United States have already experienced costly 
impacts—in terms of both lives lost and economic 
damages—from observed changes in the frequen­
cy, intensity, or duration of certain extreme events. 
While it is intuitive that extremes can have health 
impacts such as death or injury during an event 
(for example, drowning during floods), health 
impacts can also occur before or after an extreme 
event, as individuals may be involved in activi­
ties that put their health at risk, such as disaster 
preparation and post-event cleanup. Health risks 
may also arise long after the event, or in places 
outside the area where the event took place, as a 
result of damage to property, destruction of assets, 
loss of infrastructure and public services, social 
and economic impacts, environmental degradation, 
and other factors. 
Extreme events also pose unique health risks if 
multiple events occur simultaneously or in succes­
sion in a given location. The severity and extent 
of health effects associated with extreme events 
depend on the physical impacts of the extreme 
events themselves as well as the unique human, 
societal, and environmental circumstances at the 
time and place where events occur. 
This figure provides 10-year estimates of fatalities related to extreme events from 2004 to 2013,4 as well as estimated economic 
damages from 58 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion (see Smith and Katz 2013 to understand 
how total losses were calculated).5 These statistics are indicative of the human and economic costs of extreme weather events 
over this time period. Climate change will alter the frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution of some of these extremes,1 
which has consequences for exposure to health risks from extreme events. Trends and future projections for some extremes, 
including tornadoes, lightning, and wind storms are still uncertain (see Ch. 4: Extreme Events).

Disruption of Essential Infrastructure
Key Finding 2: Many types of extreme events 
related to climate change cause disruption of 
infrastructure, including power, water, transportation, 
and communication systems, that are essential to 
maintaining access to health care and emergency 
response services and safeguarding human health 
[High Confidence].
Vulnerability to Coastal Flooding
Key Finding 3: Coastal populations with greater 
vulnerability to health impacts from coastal flooding 
include persons with disabilities or other access and 
functional needs, certain populations of color, older 
adults, pregnant women and children, low-income 
populations, and some occupational groups [High 
Confidence]. Climate change will increase exposure 
risk to coastal flooding due to increases in extreme 
precipitation and in hurricane intensity and rainfall 
rates, as well as sea level rise and the resulting 
increases in storm surge [High Confidence].

Increased Exposure to Extreme Events
Key Finding 1: Health impacts associated 
with climate-related changes in exposure to 
extreme events include death, injury, or illness; 
exacerbation of underlying medical conditions; 
and adverse effects on mental health [High 
Confidence]. Climate change will increase 
exposure risk in some regions of the United States 
due to projected increases in the frequency and/or 
intensity of drought, wildfires, and flooding related 
to extreme precipitation and hurricanes [Medium 
Confidence].

Vector-borne diseases are illnesses that are 
transmitted by vectors, which include mosqui­
toes, ticks, and fleas. These vectors can carry 
infective pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, 
and protozoa, which can be transferred from one 
host (carrier) to another. The seasonality, distri­
bution, and prevalence of vector-borne diseases 
are influenced significantly by climate factors, 
primarily high and low temperature extremes 
and precipitation patterns. 
Climate change is likely to have both short- and 
long-term effects on vector-borne disease trans­
mission and infection patterns, affecting both 
seasonal risk and broad geographic changes in 
disease occurrence over decades. While climate 
variability and climate change both alter the 
transmission of vector-borne diseases, they will 
likely interact with many other factors, including 
how pathogens adapt and change, the availabil­
ity of hosts, changing ecosystems and land use, 
demographics, human behavior, and adaptive 
capacity. These complex interactions make it 
difficult to predict the effects of climate change 
on vector-borne diseases.

Changing Distributions of Vectors and 
Vector-Borne Diseases
Key Finding 1: Climate change is expected to 
alter the geographic and seasonal distributions of 
existing vectors and vector-borne diseases [Likely, 
High Confidence].
Earlier Tick Activity and Northward Range 
Expansion
Key Finding 2: Ticks capable of carrying the 
bacteria that cause Lyme disease and other 
pathogens will show earlier seasonal activity and 
a generally northward expansion in response to 
increasing temperatures associated with climate 
change [Likely, High Confidence]. Longer seasonal 
activity and expanding geographic range of these 
ticks will increase the risk of human exposure to 
ticks [Likely, Medium Confidence].
Changing Mosquito-Borne Disease 
Dynamics
Key Finding 3: Rising temperatures, changing 
precipitation patterns, and a higher frequency 
of some extreme weather events associated with 
climate change will influence the distribution, 
abundance, and prevalence of infection in the 
mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus and 
other pathogens by altering habitat availability and 
mosquito and viral reproduction rates [Very Likely, 
High Confidence]. Alterations in the distribution, 
abundance, and infection rate of mosquitoes will 
influence human exposure to bites from infected 
mosquitoes, which is expected to alter risk for 
human disease [Very Likely, Medium Confidence].
Emergence of New Vector-Borne 
Pathogens
Key Finding 4: Vector-borne pathogens are 
expected to emerge or reemerge due to the 
interactions of climate factors with many other 
drivers, such as changing land-use patterns 
[Likely, High Confidence]. The impacts to human 
disease, however, will be limited by the adaptive 
capacity of human populations, such as vector 
control practices or personal protective measures 
[Likely, High Confidence].

Precipitation and temperature changes affect fresh and marine water quantity and quality primarily through urban, 
rural, and agriculture runoff. This runoff in turn affects human exposure to water-related illnesses primarily through 
contamination of drinking water, recreational water, and fish or shellfish (see Ch. 6: Water-Related Illness).
Across most of the United States, climate change 
is expected to affect fresh and marine water 
resources in ways that will increase people’s 
exposure to water-related contaminants that cause 
illness. Water-related illnesses include waterborne 
diseases caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, 
viruses, and protozoa. Water-related illnesses 
are also caused by toxins produced by certain 
harmful algae and cyanobacteria and by chemicals 
introduced into the environment by human 
activities. Exposure occurs through ingestion, 
inhalation, or direct contact with contaminated 
drinking or recreational water and through 
consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. 
Factors related to climate change—including 
temperature, precipitation and related runoff, 
hurricanes, and storm surge—affect the growth, 
survival, spread, and virulence or toxicity of agents 
(causes) of water-related illness. Whether or not 
illness results from exposure to contaminated 
water, fish, or shellfish is dependent on a complex 
set of factors, including human behavior and social 
determinants of health that may affect a person’s 
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. 
Water resource, public health, and environmental 
agencies in the United States provide many public 
health safeguards to reduce risk of exposure and 
illness even if water becomes contaminated. These 
include water quality monitoring, drinking water 
treatment standards and practices, beach closures, 
and issuing advisories for boiling drinking water 
and harvesting shellfish.

Seasonal and Geographic Changes in 
Waterborne Illness Risk
Key Finding 1: Increases in water temperatures 
associated with climate change will alter the 
seasonal windows of growth and the geographic 
range of suitable habitat for freshwater toxin-
producing harmful algae [Very Likely, High 
Confidence], certain naturally occurring Vibrio 
bacteria [Very Likely, Medium Confidence], and 
marine toxin-producing harmful algae [Likely, 
Medium Confidence]. These changes will increase 
the risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens and 
algal toxins that can cause a variety of illnesses 
[Medium Confidence].
Runoff from Extreme Precipitation 
Increases Exposure Risk
Key Finding 2:  Runoff from more frequent 
and intense extreme precipitation events will 
increasingly compromise recreational waters, 
shellfish harvesting waters, and sources of 
drinking water through increased introduction of 
pathogens and prevalence of toxic algal blooms 
[High Confidence]. As a result, the risk of human 
exposure to agents of water-related illness will 
increase [Medium Confidence].
Water Infrastructure Failure
Key Finding 3: Increases in some extreme weather 
events and storm surges will increase the risk 
that infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater, 
and stormwater will fail due to either damage 
or exceedance of system capacity, especially in 
areas with aging infrastructure [High Confidence]. 
As a result, the risk of exposure to water-related 
pathogens, chemicals, and algal toxins will 
increase in recreational and shellfish harvesting 
waters, and in drinking water where treatment 
barriers break down [Medium Confidence].

The food system involves a network of interactions with our physical and biological environments as food 
moves from production to consumption, or from “farm to table.” Rising CO2 and climate change will affect the 
quality and distribution of food, with subsequent effects on food safety and nutrition (see Ch. 7: Food Safety).
Farm to Table
The Potential Interactions of Rising CO2 and Climate Change on Food Safety
A safe and nutritious food supply is a vital com­
ponent of food security. The impacts of climate 
change on food production, prices, and trade for 
the United States and globally have been widely 
examined, including in the recent report “Climate 
Change, Global Food Security, and the U.S. Food 
System.”7 An overall finding of that report was 
that “climate change is very likely to affect global, 
regional, and local food security by disrupting food 
availability, decreasing access to food, and making 
utilization more difficult.” 
This chapter focuses on some of the less reported 
aspects of food security, specifically the impacts 
of climate change on food safety, nutrition, and 
distribution. There are two overarching means by 
which increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate 
change alter safety, nutrition, and distribution of 
food. The first is associated with rising global tem­
peratures and the subsequent changes in weather 
patterns and extreme climate events. Current and 
anticipated changes in climate and the physical 
environment have consequences for contamina­
tion, spoilage, and the disruption of food distri­
bution. The second pathway is through the direct 
CO2 “fertilization” effect on plant photosynthesis. 
Higher concentrations of CO2 stimulate growth and 
carbohydrate production in some plants, but can 
lower the levels of protein and essential minerals 
in a number of widely consumed crops, including 
wheat, rice, and potatoes, with potentially negative 
implications for human nutrition.

Increased Risk of Foodborne Illness
Key Finding 1: Climate change, including 
rising temperatures and changes in weather 
extremes, is expected to increase the exposure 
of food to certain pathogens and toxins [Likely, 
High Confidence]. This will increase the risk 
of negative health impacts [Likely, Medium 
Confidence], but actual incidence of foodborne 
illness will depend on the efficacy of practices 
that safeguard food in the United States [High 
Confidence]. 
Chemical Contaminants in the Food 
Chain
Key Finding 2: Climate change will increase 
human exposure to chemical contaminants in 
food through several pathways [Likely, Medium 
Confidence]. Elevated sea surface temperatures 
will lead to greater accumulation of mercury 
in seafood [Likely, Medium Confidence], 
while increases in extreme weather events will 
introduce contaminants into the food chain 
[Likely, Medium Confidence]. Rising carbon 
dioxide concentrations and climate change 
will alter incidence and distribution of pests, 
parasites, and microbes [Very Likely, High 
Confidence], leading to increases in the use of 
pesticides and veterinary drugs [Likely, Medium 
Confidence].
Rising Carbon Dioxide Lowers Nutritional 
Value of Food
Key Finding 3: The nutritional value of 
agriculturally important food crops, such as 
wheat and rice, will decrease as rising levels of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to reduce the 
concentrations of protein and essential minerals in 
most plant species [Very Likely, High Confidence].
Extreme Weather Limits Access to Safe 
Foods
Key Finding 4: Increases in the frequency or 
intensity of some extreme weather events 
associated with climate change will increase 
disruptions of food distribution by damaging 
existing infrastructure or slowing food shipments 
[Likely, High Confidence]. These impediments lead 
to increased risk for food damage, spoilage, or 
contamination, which will limit availability of and 
access to safe and nutritious food depending on 
the extent of disruption and the resilience of food 
distribution infrastructure [Medium Confidence].

Children are at particular risk for distress, anxiety, and 
other adverse mental health effects in the aftermath of 
an extreme event.
The effects of global climate change on mental 
health and well-being are integral parts of the overall 
climate-related human health impacts. Mental health 
consequences of climate change range from minimal 
stress and distress symptoms to clinical disorders, 
such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, 
and suicidality. Other consequences include effects 
on the everyday life, perceptions, and experiences of 
individuals and communities attempting to under­
stand and respond appropriately to climate change 
and its implications. The mental health and well-be­
ing consequences of climate change related impacts 
rarely occur in isolation, but often interact with other 
social and environmental stressors. The interactive 
and cumulative nature of climate change effects on 
health, mental health, and well-being are critical 
factors in understanding the overall consequences of 
climate change on human health.

Exposure to Disasters Results in Mental 
Health Consequences
Key Finding 1: Many people exposed to 
climate-related or weather-related disasters 
experience stress and serious mental health 
consequences. Depending on the type of the 
disaster, these consequences include post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, 
and general anxiety, which often occur at the 
same time [Very High Confidence]. The majority 
of affected people recover over time, although 
a significant proportion of exposed individuals 
develop chronic psychological dysfunction [High 
Confidence].	
Specific Groups of People Are at 
Higher Risk 
Key Finding 2: Specific groups of people are at 
higher risk for distress and other adverse mental 
health consequences from exposure to climate-
related or weather-related disasters. These groups 
include children, the elderly, women (especially 
pregnant and post-partum women), people with 
preexisting mental illness, the economically 
disadvantaged, the homeless, and first responders 
[High Confidence]. Communities that rely on the 
natural environment for sustenance and livelihood, 
as well as populations living in areas most 
susceptible to specific climate change events, 
are at increased risk for adverse mental health 
outcomes [High Confidence].
Climate Change Threats Result in Mental 
Health Consequences and Social Impacts
Key Finding 3: Many people will experience adverse 
mental health outcomes and social impacts from 
the threat of climate change, the perceived direct 
experience of climate change, and changes to 
one’s local environment [High Confidence]. Media 
and popular culture representations of climate 
change influence stress responses and mental 
health and well-being [Medium Confidence].
Extreme Heat Increases Risks for People 
with Mental Illness
Key Finding 4: People with mental illness are at 
higher risk for poor physical and mental health 
due to extreme heat [High Confidence]. Increases 
in extreme heat will increase the risk of disease 
and death for people with mental illness, including 
elderly populations and those taking prescription 
medications that impair the body’s ability to 
regulate temperature [High Confidence].

Determinants of Vulnerability
Defining the determinants of vulnerability to health impacts associated with climate change, including 
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (see Ch. 9: Populations of Concern). (Figure source: adapted 
from Turner et al. 2003)8
Climate change is already causing, and is expected 
to continue to cause, a range of health impacts 
that vary across different population groups in 
the United States. The vulnerability of any given 
group is a function of its sensitivity to climate 
change related health risks, its exposure to those 
risks, and its capacity for responding to or coping 
with climate variability and change. Vulnerable 
groups of people, described here as populations 
of concern, include those with low income, some 
communities of color, immigrant groups (including 
those with limited English proficiency), Indige­
nous peoples, children and pregnant women, older 
adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons 
with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or 
chronic medical conditions. Characterizations of 
vulnerability should consider how populations of 
concern experience disproportionate, multiple, 
and complex risks to their health and well-being in 
response to climate change.
Vulnerability Varies Over Time and Is 
Place-Specific
Key Finding 1: Across the United States, people 
and communities differ in their exposure, their 
inherent sensitivity, and their adaptive capacity to 
respond to and cope with climate change related 
health threats [Very High Confidence]. Vulnerability 
to climate change varies across time and location, 
across communities, and among individuals within 
communities [Very High Confidence].
Health Impacts Vary with Age and Life 
Stage
Key Finding 2: People experience different inherent 
sensitivities to the impacts of climate change at 
different ages and life stages [High Confidence]. 
For example, the very young and the very old are 
particularly sensitive to climate-related health 
impacts.

Social Determinants of Health Interact 
with Climate Factors to Affect Health Risk
Key Finding 3: Climate change threatens the 
health of people and communities by affecting 
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity [High 
Confidence]. Social determinants of health, 
such as those related to socioeconomic factors 
and health disparities, may amplify, moderate, 
or otherwise influence climate-related health 
effects, particularly when these factors occur 
simultaneously or close in time or space [High 
Confidence]. 
Mapping Tools and Vulnerability Indices 
Identify Climate Health Risks 
Key Finding 4: The use of geographic data and 
tools allows for more sophisticated mapping of risk 
factors and social vulnerabilities to identify and 
protect specific locations and groups of people 
[High Confidence].

Because of existing vulnerabilities, Indigenous people, especially those who are dependent on the environment for sustenance 
or who live in geographically isolated or impoverished communities, are likely to experience greater exposure and lower 
resilience to climate-related health effects.

Key Findings 
Exacerbated Ozone Health Impacts 
Key Finding 1: Climate change will make it harder for any given regulatory approach to reduce ground-level 
ozone pollution in the future as meteorological conditions become increasingly conducive to forming ozone 
over most of the United States [Likely, High Confidence]. Unless offset by additional emissions reductions of 
ozone precursors, these climate-driven increases in ozone will cause premature deaths, hospital visits, lost 
school days, and acute respiratory symptoms [Likely, High Confidence].
Increased Health Impacts from Wildfires
Key Finding 2: Wildfires emit fine particles and ozone precursors that in turn increase the risk of premature 
death and adverse chronic and acute cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes [Likely, High 
Confidence]. Climate change is projected to increase the number and severity of naturally occurring wildfires 
in parts of the United States, increasing emissions of particulate matter and ozone precursors and resulting 
in additional adverse health outcomes [Likely, High Confidence].
Worsened Allergy and Asthma Conditions 
Key Finding 3: Changes in climate, specifically rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and 
increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, are expected to contribute to increases in the 
levels of some airborne allergens and associated increases in asthma episodes and other allergic illnesses 
[High Confidence].

3.1	 Introduction 
Changes in the climate affect the air we breathe, both indoors 
and outdoors. Taken together, changes in the climate affect 
air quality through three pathways—via outdoor air pollution, 
aeroallergens, and indoor air pollution. The changing climate 
has modified weather patterns, which in turn have influenced 
the levels and location of outdoor air pollutants such as 
ground-level ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter.1, 2, 3, 4 In­
creasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels also promote the growth 
of plants that release airborne allergens (aeroallergens). Final­
ly, these changes to outdoor air quality and aeroallergens also 
affect indoor air quality as both pollutants and aeroallergens 
infiltrate homes, schools, and other buildings. 
Climate change influences outdoor air pollutant concentra­
tions in many ways (Figure 1). The climate influences tempera­
tures, cloudiness, humidity, the frequency and intensity of 
precipitation, and wind patterns,5 each of which can influ­
ence air quality. At the same time, climate-driven changes in 
meteorology can also lead to changes in naturally occurring 
emissions that influence air quality (for example, wildfires, 
wind-blown dust, and emissions from vegetation). Over longer 
time scales, human responses to climate change may also 
affect the amount of energy that humans use, as well as how 
land is used and where people live. These changes would in 
turn modify emissions (depending on the fuel source) and 
thus further influence air quality.6, 7 Some air pollutants such 
as ozone, sulfates, and black carbon also cause changes in 
Figure 1: This conceptual diagram for an outdoor air quality example illustrates the key pathways by which humans are exposed to 
health threats from climate drivers, and potential resulting health outcomes (center boxes). These exposure pathways exist within the 
context of other factors that positively or negatively influence health outcomes (gray side boxes). Key factors that influence vulnerability 
for individuals are shown in the right box, and include social determinants of health and behavioral choices. Key factors that influence 
vulnerability at larger scales, such as natural and built environments, governance and management, and institutions, are shown in the 
left box. All of these influencing factors can affect an individual’s or a community’s vulnerability through changes in exposure, sensitivity, 
and adaptive capacity and may also be affected by climate change. See Chapter 1: Introduction for more information.

climate.8 However, this chapter does not consider the climate 
effects of air pollutants, remaining focused on the health 
effects resulting from climate-related changes in air pollution 
exposure.
Poor air quality, whether outdoors or indoors, can negative­
ly affect the human respiratory and cardiovascular systems. 
Outdoor ground-level ozone and particle pollution can have 
a range of adverse effects on human health. Current levels of 
ground-level ozone have been estimated to be responsible 
for tens of thousands of hospital and emergency room visits, 
millions of cases of acute respiratory symptoms and school 
absences, and thousands of premature deaths each year 
in the United States.9, 10 Fine 
particle pollution has also been 
linked to even greater health 
consequences through harmful 
cardiovascular and respiratory 
effects.11 
A changing climate can also 
influence the level of aeroal­
lergens such as pollen, which 
in turn adversely affect human 
health. Rising levels of CO2 and resulting climate changes alter 
the production, allergenicity (a measure of how much particu­
lar allergens, such as ragweed, affect people), distribution, and 
seasonal timing of aeroallergens. These changes increase the 
severity and prevalence of allergic diseases in humans. Higher 
pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons can increase 
allergic sensitization and asthma episodes and thereby limit 
productivity at work and school.
Finally, climate change may alter the indoor concentrations of 
pollutants generated outdoors (such as ground-level ozone), 
particulate matter, and aeroallergens (such as pollen). Changes 
in the climate may also increase pollutants generated indoors, 
such as mold and volatile organic compounds. Most of the 
air people breathe over their lifetimes will be indoors, since 
people spend the vast majority of their time in indoor environ­
ments. Thus, alterations in indoor air pollutant concentrations 
from climate change have important health implications.
3.2	 Climate Impacts on Outdoor Air Pollutants and 
Health
Changes in the climate affect air pollution levels.8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Human-caused climate change has the potential 
to increase ozone levels,1, 4 may have already increased ozone 
pollution in some regions of the United States,3 and has the 
potential to affect future concentrations of ozone and fine par­
ticles (particulate matter smaller 
than 2.5 microns in diameter, 
referred to as PM2.5).2, 7 Climate 
change and air quality are both 
affected by, and influence, sev­
eral factors; these include the 
levels and types of pollutants 
emitted, how land is used, the 
chemistry governing how these 
pollutants form in the atmo­
sphere, and weather conditions. 
Ground-Level Ozone
Ozone levels and subsequent ozone-related health impacts de­
pend on 1) the amount of pollutants emitted that form ozone, 
and 2) the meteorological conditions that help determine 
the amount of ozone produced from those emissions. Both 
of these factors are expected to change in the future. The 
emissions of pollutants from anthropogenic (of human origin) 
sources that form ozone (that is, ozone “precursors”) are 
expected to decrease over the next few decades in the United 
States.23 However, irrespective of these changes in emissions, 
climate change will result in meteorological conditions more 
favorable to forming ozone. Consequently, attaining national 
air quality standards for ground-level ozone will also be more 
difficult, as climate changes offset some of the improvements 
that would otherwise be expected from emissions reductions. 
This effect is referred to as the “climate penalty.”7, 24 
Meteorological conditions influencing ozone levels include air 
temperatures, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, wind trajec­
tories, and the amount of vertical mixing in the atmosphere.1, 
2, 25, 26 Higher temperatures can increase the chemical rates at 
which ozone is formed and increase ozone precursor emissions 
from anthropogenic sources and biogenic (vegetative) sources. 
Lower relative humidity reduces cloud cover and rainfall, pro­
moting the formation of ozone and extending ozone lifetime in 
the atmosphere. A changing climate will also modify wind pat­
terns across the United States, which will influence local ozone 
levels. Over much of the country, the worst ozone episodes tend 
to occur when the local air mass does not change over a period 
of several days, allowing ozone and ozone precursor emissions 
Higher pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons can 
increase allergic sensitization and asthma episodes.
Human-caused climate change has the 
potential to increase ozone levels, may have 
already increased ozone pollution in some 
regions of the United States, and has the 
potential to affect future concentrations of 
ozone and fine particles.

to accumulate over time.27, 28 Climate change is already increas­
ing the frequency of these types of stagnation events over parts 
of the United States,3 and further increases are projected.29 
Ozone concentrations near the ground are strongly influenced 
by upward and downward movement of air (“vertical mixing”). 
For example, high concentrations of ozone near the ground of­
ten occur in urban areas when there is downward movement of 
air associated with high pressure (“subsidence”), reducing the 
extent to which locally emitted pollutants are diluted in the at­
mosphere.30 In addition, high concentrations of ozone can occur 
in some rural areas resulting from downward transport of ozone 
from the stratosphere or upper troposphere to the ground.31
Aside from the direct meteorological influences, there are also 
indirect impacts on U.S. ozone levels from other climate-in­
fluenced factors. For instance, higher water vapor concentra­
tions due to increased temperatures will increase the natural 
rate of ozone depletion, particularly in remote areas,32 thus 
decreasing the baseline level of ozone. Additionally, potential 
climate-driven increases in nitrogen oxides (NOx) created by 
lightning or increased exchange of naturally produced ozone 
in the stratosphere to the troposphere could also affect ozone 
in those areas of the country most influenced by background 
ozone concentrations.33 Increased occurrences of wildfires due 
to climate change can also lead to increased ozone concentra­
tions near the ground.34  
There is natural year-to-year variability in temperature and 
other meteorological factors that influence ozone levels.7 
While global average temperature over 30-year climatic times­
cales is expected to increase, natural interannual variability 
will continue to play a significant role in year-to-year changes 
in temperature.35 Over the next several decades, the influence 
of climate change on meteorological parameters affecting 
average levels of ozone is expected to be smaller than the 
natural interannual variability.36 
To address these issues, most assessments of climate impacts 
on meteorology and associated ozone formation concurrently 
simulate global and regional chemical transport over multiple 
years using “coupled” models. This approach can isolate the 
influence of meteorology in forming ozone from the effect of 
changes in emissions. The consensus of these model-based 
assessments is that accelerated rates of photochemical reac­
tion, increased occurrence of stagnation events, and other 
direct meteorological influences are likely to lead to higher 
levels of ozone over large portions of the United States.8, 14, 16, 17 
At the same time, ozone levels in certain regions are projected 
to decrease as a result of climate change, likely due to localized 
increases in cloud cover, precipitation, and/or increased dilution 
resulting from deeper mixed layers. These climate-driven chang­
es in projected ozone vary by season and location, with climate 
and air quality models showing the most consistency in ozone 
increases due to climate change in the northeastern United 
States.8, 37 
Generally, ozone levels will likely increase across the United 
States if ozone precursors are unchanged (see "Research High­
light: Ozone-Related Health Effects" on page 74).4, 7, 8 This cli­
mate penalty for ozone will offset some of the expected health 
benefits that would otherwise result from the expected ongoing 
reductions of ozone precursor emissions, and could prompt the 
need for adaptive measures (for example, additional ozone pre­
cursor emissions reductions) to meet national air quality goals. 
Ozone (O3) is a compound that occurs naturally in Earth’s atmosphere but is also formed by human activities. In 
the stratosphere (10–50 kilometers above the Earth’s surface), O3 prevents harmful solar ultraviolet radiation from 
reaching the Earth’s surface. Near the surface, however, O3 irritates the respiratory system. Ground-level O3, a key 
component of smog, is formed by chemical interactions between sunlight and pollutants including nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emissions leading to O3 formation can result from both human 
sources (for example, motor vehicles and electric power generation) and natural sources (for example, vegetation 
and wildfires). Occasionally, O3 that is created naturally in the stratosphere can be mixed downward and contribute 
to O3 levels near the surface. Once formed, O3 can be transported by the wind before eventually being removed from 
the atmosphere via chemical reactions or by depositing on the surface. 
At any given location, O3 levels are influenced by complex interactions between emissions and meteorological 
conditions. Generally, higher temperatures, sunnier skies, and lighter winds lead to higher O3 concentrations by 
increasing the rate of chemical reactions and by decreasing the extent to which pollutants are mixed with “clean” 
(less polluted) background air. 
For a given level of emissions of O3 precursors, climate change is generally expected to increase O3 pollution in the 
future throughout much of the United States, in part due to higher temperatures and more frequent stagnant air 
conditions.7 Unless offset by additional emissions reductions of ozone precursors, these climate-driven increases in 
O3 will cause premature deaths, hospital visits, lost school days, and acute respiratory symptoms.14
What is Ozone?

Research Highlight: Ozone-Related Health Effects
Importance: Ozone is formed in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. Although U.S. air quality policies are projected to reduce 
VOC and NOx emissions,56 climate change will increase the frequency of regional weather patterns conducive to 
increasing ground-level ozone, partially offsetting the expected improvements in air quality. 
Objective: Project the number and geographic distribution of additional ozone-related illnesses and premature 
deaths in the contiguous United States due to climate change between 2000 and 2030 under projected U.S. air 
quality policies.
Method: Climate scenarios from two global climate models (GCMs) using two different emissions pathways 
(RCP8.5 and RCP6.0) were dynamically downscaled following Otte et al. (2012)57 and used with emissions 
projections for 2030 and a regional chemical transport model to simulate air quality in the contiguous United 
States. The resulting changes in ozone in each scenario were then used to compute regional ozone-related health 
effects attributable to climate change. Ozone-related health impacts were estimated using the environmental 
Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program–Community Edition (BenMAP–CE). Population exposure was estimated 
using projected population data from the Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios (ICLUS). Further details can 
be found in Fann et al. (2015).14
Results: The two downscaled GCM projections result in 1°C to 4°C (1.8°F to 7.2°F) increases in average daily 
maximum temperatures and 1 to 5 parts per billion increases in daily 8-hour maximum ozone in 2030 throughout 
the contiguous United States. As seen in previous modeling analyses of climate impacts on ozone, the air quality 
response to climate change can vary substantially by region and across scenarios.22, 58 Unless reductions in ozone 
precursor emissions offset the influence of climate change, this climate penalty of increased ozone concentrations 
due to climate change would result in tens to thousands of additional ozone-related illnesses and premature 
deaths per year.

Conclusions: Future climate change will result in higher ozone levels in polluted regions of the contiguous 
United States. This study isolates the effect of climate change on ozone by using the same emissions of ozone 
precursors for both 2000-era and 2030-era climate. In addition, this study uses the latest generation of GCM 
scenarios and represents the most comprehensive analysis of climate-related, ozone-attributable health effects 
in 2030, and includes not only deaths but also emergency department admissions for asthma, hospital visits for 
respiratory causes, acute respiratory symptoms, and missed days of school. These results are subject to important 
uncertainties and limitations. The ozone-climate modeling reflects two scenarios (based on two separate GCMs) 
considered. Several emissions categories that are important in the formation of ozone and that could be affected 
by climate, such as motor vehicles, electrical generating units, and wildfires, were left unchanged between the 
current and future periods. The analysis applied concentration–response relationships from epidemiology studies 
of historical air pollution episodes; this both implies that the relationship between air pollution and risk will 
remain constant into the future and that populations will not attempt to reduce their exposure to ozone. 
Projected Change in Temperature, Ozone, and Ozone-Related Premature Deaths in 2030

8-hour ozone (parts per billion), and excess ozone-related deaths (incidences per year by county) in the year 2030 relative to 
the year 2000, following two global climate models and two greenhouse gas concentration pathways, known as Representative 
Concentration Pathways, or RCPs (see van Vuuren et al. 201149). Each year (2000 and 2030) is represented by 11 years of 
modeled data for May through September, the traditional ozone season in the United States. 
The top panels are based on the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy (NCAR/DOE) Community 
Earth System Model (CESM) following RCP8.5 (a higher greenhouse gas concentration pathway), and the bottom panels are

following RCP6.0 (a moderate greenhouse gas concentration pathway). 
The leftmost panels are based on dynamically downscaled regional climate using the NCAR Weather Research and Forecasting

and Mapping Program (BenMAP). 
Fann et al. 2015 reports a range of mortality outcomes based on different methods of computing the mortality effects of ozone 
changes—the changes in the number of deaths shown in the rightmost panels were computed using the method described in 
Bell et al. 2004.14, 38 (Figure source: adapted from Fann et al. 2015)14

Air pollution epidemiology studies describe the relationship 
between a population’s historical exposure to air pollutants 
and the risk of adverse health outcomes. Populations exposed 
to ozone air pollution are at greater risk of dying prematurely, 
being admitted to the hospital for respiratory hospital ad­
missions, being admitted to the emergency department, and 
suffering from aggravated asthma, among other impacts.38, 39, 40 
Air pollution health impact assessments combine risk estimates 
from these epidemiology studies with modeled changes in 
future or historical air quality changes to estimate the number 
of air-pollution-related premature deaths and illness.41 Future 
ozone-related human health impacts attributable to climate 
change are projected to lead to hundreds to thousands of pre­
mature deaths, hospital admissions, and cases of acute respira­
tory illnesses per year in the United States in 2030.14, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
Health outcomes that can be attributed to climate change 
impacts on air pollution are sensitive to a number of factors 
noted above—including the climate models used to describe 
meteorological changes (including precipitation and cloud 
cover), the models simulating air quality levels (including 
wildfire incidence), the size and distribution of the population 
exposed, and the health status of that population (which in­
fluences their susceptibility to air pollution; see Ch. 1: Intro­
duction).42, 47, 48, 49 Moreover, there is emerging evidence that 
air pollution can interact with climate-related stressors such as 
temperature to affect the human physiological response to air 
pollution.39, 42, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 For example, the risk of dying from 
exposure to a given level of ozone may increase on warmer 
days.51
Particulate Matter
Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid- or 
liquid-phase substances in the atmosphere that arise from 
both natural and human sources. Principal constituents of PM 
include sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemen­
tal carbon, sea salt, and dust. These particles (also known as 
aerosols) can either be directly emitted or can be formed in 
the atmosphere from gas-phase precursors. PM smaller than 
2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) is associated with serious 
chronic and acute health effects, including lung cancer, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, 
and asthma development and exacerbation.11 The elderly are 
particularly sensitive to short-term particle exposure, with a 
higher risk of hospitalization and death.59, 60 
As is the case for ozone, atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations 
depend on emissions and on meteorology. Emissions of sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), NOx, and black carbon are projected to decline 
substantially in the United States over the next few decades 
due to regulatory controls,56, 61, 62, 63 which will lead to reduc­
tions in sulfate and nitrate aerosols.

Climate change is expected to alter several meteorological 
factors that affect PM2.5, including precipitation patterns and 
humidity, although there is greater consensus regarding the 
effects of meteorological changes on ozone than on PM2.5.2 
Several factors, such as increased humidity, increased stag­
nation events, and increased biogenic emissions are likely to 
increase PM2.5 levels, while increases in precipitation, en­
hanced atmospheric mixing, and other factors could decrease 
PM2.5 levels.2, 8, 37, 64 Because of the strong influence of changes 
in precipitation and atmospheric mixing on PM2.5 levels, and 
because there is more variability in projected changes to those 
variables, there is no consensus yet on whether meteorolog­
ical changes will lead to a net increase or decrease in PM2.5 
levels in the United States.2, 8, 17, 21, 22, 64, 65 
As a result, while it is clear that PM2.5 accounts for most of the 
health burden of outdoor air pollution in the United States,10 
the health effects of climate-induced changes in PM2.5 are 
poorly quantified. Some studies have found that changes in 
PM2.5 will be the dominant driver of air quality-related health 
effects due to climate change,44 while others have suggested 
a potentially more significant health burden from changes in 
ozone.50 
PM resulting from natural sources (such as plants, wildfires, 
and dust) is sensitive to daily weather patterns, and those fluc­
tuations can affect the intensity of extreme PM episodes (see 
also Ch. 4: Extreme Events, Section 4.6).8 Wildfires are a major 
source of PM, especially in the western United States during 
summer.66, 67, 68 Because winds carry PM2.5 and ozone precursor 
gases, air pollution from wildfires can affect people even far 
downwind from the fire location.35, 69 PM2.5 from wildfires af­
fects human health by increasing the risk of premature death 
and hospital and emergency department visits.70, 71, 72 
Climate change has already led to an increased frequency 
of large wildfires, as well as longer durations of individual 
wildfires and longer wildfire seasons in the western United 
States.73 Future climate change is projected to increase wild­
fire risks74, 75 and associated emissions, with harmful impacts 
on health.76 The area burned by wildfires in North America is 
expected to increase dramatically over the 21st century due to 
climate change.77, 78 By 2050, changes in wildfires in the west­
ern United States are projected to result in 40% increases of 
organic carbon and 20% increases in elemental carbon aerosol 
concentrations.79 Wildfires may dominate summertime PM2.5 
concentrations, offsetting even large reductions in anthropo­
genic PM2.5 emissions.22 
Likewise, dust can be an important constituent of PM, espe­
cially in the southwest United States. The severity and spatial 
extent of drought has been projected to increase as a result 
of climate change,80 though the impact of increased aridity on 
airborne dust PM has not been quantified (see Ch. 4. Extreme 
Events).2 
3.3	 Climate Impacts on Aeroallergens and 
Respiratory Diseases
Climate change may alter the production, allergenicity, distri­
bution, and timing of airborne allergens (aeroallergens). These 
changes contribute to the severity and prevalence of allergic 
disease in humans. The very young, those with compromised 
immune systems, and the medically uninsured bear the brunt 
of asthma and other allergic illnesses. While aeroallergen 
exposure is not the sole, or even necessarily the most signifi­
cant factor associated with allergic illnesses, that relationship 
is part of a complex pathway that links aeroallergen expo­
sure to the prevalence of allergic illnesses, including asthma 
episodes.81, 82 On the other hand, climate change may reduce 
adverse allergic and asthmatic responses in some areas. For 
example, as some areas become drier, there is the potential 
for a shortening of the pollen season due to plant stress. 
Aeroallergens and Rates of Allergic Diseases in the United 
States 
Aeroallergens are substances present in the air that, once 
inhaled, stimulate an allergic response in sensitized individu­
als. Aeroallergens include tree, grass, and weed pollen; indoor 
and outdoor molds; and other allergenic proteins associated 
with animal dander, dust mites, and cockroaches.83 Ragweed 
is the aeroallergen that most commonly affects persons in the 
United States.84 
Allergic diseases develop in response to complex and multi­
ple interactions among both genetic and non-genetic factors, 
including a developing immune system, environmental expo­
sures (such as ambient air pollution or weather conditions), 
and socioeconomic and demographic factors.85, 86, 87 Aeroal­
lergen exposure contributes to the occurrence of asthma 
episodes, allergic rhinitis or hay fever, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, 
urticaria (hives), atopic dermatitis or eczema, and anaphylaxis 
(a severe, whole-body allergic reaction that can be life-threat­
Nearly 6.8 million children in the United States are affected by 
asthma, making it a major chronic disease of childhood.

ening).84, 88 Allergic illnesses, including hay fever, affect about 
one-third of the U.S. population, and more than 34 million 
Americans have been diagnosed with asthma.81 These diseases 
have increased in the United States over the past 30 years (see 
Ch. 1 Introduction). The prevalence of hay fever has increased 
from 10% of the population in 1970 to 30% in 2000.84 Asthma 
rates have increased from approximately 8 to 55 cases per 
1,000 persons to approximately 55 to 90 cases per 1,000 per­
sons over that same time period;89 however, there is variation 
in reports of active cases of asthma as a function of geography 
and demographics.90 
Climate Impacts on Aeroallergen Characteristics 
Climate change contributes to changes in allergic illnesses as 
greater concentrations of CO2, together with higher tempera­
tures and changes in precipitation, extend the start or duration 
of the growing season, increase the quantity and allergenicity of 
pollen, and expand the spatial distribution of pollens.84, 91, 92, 93, 94 
Historical trends show that climate change has led to chang­
es in the length of the growing season for certain allergenic 
pollens. For instance, the duration of pollen release for common 
ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) has been increasing as a 
function of latitude in recent decades in the midwestern region 
of North America (see Figure 4). Latitudinal effects on increasing 
season length were associated primarily with a delay in first 
frost during the fall season and lengthening of the frost-free 
period.95 Studies in controlled indoor environments find that 
increases in temperature and CO2 result in earlier flowering, 
greater floral numbers, greater pollen production, and in­
creased allergenicity in common ragweed.96, 97 In addition, stud­
ies using urban areas as proxies for both higher CO2 and higher 
temperatures demonstrate earlier flowering of pollen species, 
which may lead to a longer total pollen season.98, 99, 100
For trees, earlier flowering associated with higher winter and 
spring temperatures has been observed over a 50-year period 
Figure 4: Ragweed pollen season length has increased in central North America between 1995 and 2011 by as much as 11 to 27 
days in parts of the United States and Canada, in response to rising temperatures. Increases in the length of this allergenic pollen 
season are correlated with increases in the number of days before the first frost. The largest increases have been observed in 
northern cities. (Figure source: Melillo et al. 2014. Photo credit: Lewis Ziska, USDA).35

for oak.101 Research on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) also demon­
strates that elevated CO2 could induce earlier and greater 
seasonal pollen production.102 Annual birch (Betula) pollen pro­
duction and peak values from 2020 to 2100 are projected to be 
1.3 to 2.3 times higher, relative to average values for 2000, with 
the start and peak dates of pollen release advancing by two to 
four weeks.103 
Climate Variability and Effects on Allergic Diseases
Climate change related alterations in local weather patterns, 
including changes in minimum and maximum temperatures 
and rainfall, affect the burden of allergic diseases.104, 105, 106 The 
role of weather on the initiation or exacerbation of allergic 
symptoms in sensitive persons is not well understood.86, 107 
So-called “thunderstorm asthma” results as allergenic parti­
cles are dispersed through osmotic rupture, a phenomenon 
where cell membranes burst. Pollen grains may, after contact 
with rain, release part of their cellular contents, including 
allergen-laced fine particles. Increases in the intensity and 
frequency of heavy rainfall and storminess over the coming 
decades is likely to be associated with spikes in aeroallergen 
concentrations and the potential for related increases in the 
number and severity of allergic illnesses.108, 109
Potential non-linear interactions between aeroallergens and 
ambient air pollutants (including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sul­
fur dioxide, and fine particulate matter) may increase health 
risks for people who are simultaneously exposed.87, 88, 106, 108, 110, 
111, 112, 113, 114 In particular, pre-exposure to air pollution (espe­
cially ozone or fine particulate matter) may magnify the effects 
of aeroallergens, as prior damage to airways may increase 
the permeability of mucous membranes to the penetration of 
allergens, although existing evidence suggests greater sensitiv­
ity but not necessarily a direct link with ozone exposure.115 A 
recent report noted remaining uncertainties across the epide­
miologic, controlled human exposure, and toxicology studies 
on this emerging topic.39
3.4	  Climate Impacts on Indoor Air Quality and 
Health: An Emerging Issue 
Climate change may worsen existing indoor air problems and 
create new problems by altering outdoor conditions that 
affect indoor conditions and by creating more favorable con­
ditions for the growth and spread of pests, infectious agents, 
and disease vectors that can migrate indoors.116 Climate 
change can also lead to changes in the mixing of outdoor and 
indoor air. Reduced mixing of outdoor and indoor air limits 
penetration of outdoor pollutants into the indoors, but also 
leads to higher concentrations of pollutants generated indoors 
since their dilution by outdoor air is decreased.
Indoor air contains a complex mixture of chemical and bio­
logical pollutants or contaminants. Contaminants that can be 
found indoors include carbon monoxide (CO), fine particles 
(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, radon, mold, and 
pollen. Indoor air quality varies from building to building and 
over the course of a day in an individual building.
Public and environmental health professionals have known for 
decades that poor indoor air quality is associated with adverse 
respiratory and other health effects.116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121 Since 
most people spend about 90% of their time indoors,122, 123, 124, 
125, 126 much of their exposures to airborne pollutants (both 
those influenced by climate change and those driven by other 
factors) happen indoors.
Outdoor Air Changes Reflected in Indoor Air 
Indoor air pollutants may come from indoor sources or may 
be transported into the building with outdoor air.127, 128 Indoor 
pollutants of outdoor origin may include ozone, dust, pollen, 
and fine PM (PM2.5). Even if a building has an outdoor air intake, 
some air will enter the building through other openings, such as 
open windows or under doors, or through cracks in the build­
ings, bypassing any filters and bringing outdoor air pollutants 
inside.129 If there are changes in airborne pollutants of outdoor 
origin, such as pollen and mold (see Section 3.3) and fine PM 
from wildfires (see "Particulate Matter" on page 76), there 
will be changes in indoor exposures to these contaminants. 
Although indoor fine PM levels from wildfires are typically lower 
than outdoors (about 50%), because people spend most of their 
time indoors, most of their exposure to and health effects from 
wildfire particles (about 80%) will come from particles inhaled 
Dampness and mold in U.S. homes are linked to approximately 
4.6 million cases of worsened asthma.

indoors.130 Climate-induced changes in indoor-outdoor tem­
perature differences may somewhat reduce the overall intake 
of outdoor pollutants into buildings for certain regions and 
seasons (see “Research Highlight: Residential Infiltration and 
Indoor Air”).131 
Most exposures to high levels of ozone occur outdoors; howev­
er, indoor exposures, while lower, occur for much longer time 
periods. Indoors, ozone concentrations are usually about 10% 
to 50% of outdoor concentrations; however, since people spend 
most of their time indoors, most of their exposure to ozone is 
from indoor air.130 Thus, about 45% to 75% of a person’s overall 
exposure to ozone will occur indoors.132 About half of the health 
effects resulting from any outdoor increases in ozone (see Sec­
tion "Ground-Level Ozone" on page 72) will be due to indoor 
ozone exposures.130 The elderly and children are particularly 
sensitive to short-term ozone exposure; however, they may 
spend even more time indoors than the general population 
and consequently their exposure to ozone is at lower levels for 
longer periods than the general public.133, 134 In addition, ozone 
Research Highlight: Residential Infiltration and Indoor Air 
Importance: Indoor and outdoor air are constantly mixing as air flows through small cracks and openings in buildings 
(infiltration) in addition to any open doors, windows, and vents. Infiltration or air exchange is driven by differences 
in barometric pressure, as a result of wind, and of the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air. The 
greater this air exchange, the more similar the composition of indoor and outdoor air. Lower air exchange rates 
accentuate the impact of indoor sources while reducing that of some outdoor pollution. As climate change increases 
the average temperature of outdoor air, while indoor air continues to be maintained at the same comfortable 
temperatures, infiltration driven by temperature differences will change as well, modifying exposure to indoor and 
outdoor air pollution sources.
Objective: Project the relative change in infiltration and its effects on exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution 
sources for different climates in the United States, between a late-20th century reference and the middle of the 
current century, in typical detached homes. 
Method: The infiltration change projected for 2040–2070 compared to 1970–2000 was modeled for typical 
single-family residences in urban areas, using temperatures and wind speeds from eight global–regional model 
combinations for nine U.S. cities (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Phoenix, 
and Seattle). This analysis compares a building to itself, removing the effects of individual building characteristics 
on infiltration. Indoor temperatures were assumed unchanged between these two periods. Further details can be 
found in Ilacqua et al. 2015.131 
Results: Because current average yearly temperatures across the contiguous United States are generally below 
comfortable indoor temperatures, model results indicate that, under future warmer temperatures, infiltration 
is projected to decrease by about 5%, averaged across cities, seasons, and climate models. Exposure to some 
pollutants emitted indoors would correspondingly increase, while exposure to some outdoor air pollutants would 
decrease to some extent. Projections vary, however, among location, seasons, and climate models. In the warmer 
cities, infiltration during summer months would rise by up to 25% in some models, raising peak exposures to ozone 
and other related pollutants just when their concentrations are typically highest. Predictions of different models are 
less consistent for summer months, however, displaying more uncertainty (average modeling relative range of 14%) 
for summer than for the rest of the year, and in fact not all models predict summer infiltration increases. Modeling 
uncertainty for the rest of the year is lower than in the summer (relative range less than 6%). 
Conclusions: This study shows the potential shifts in residential exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution sources 
driven by a changing climate.131 These conclusions can be applied to small buildings, including single-family 
homes, row houses, and small offices. Potential adaptations intended to promote energy efficiency by reducing the 
leakage area of buildings will enhance the effect of decreasing infiltration and increasing exposure to indoor sources. 
Because of its novelty and lack of additional evidence, the study results should be considered as suggestive of an 
emerging issue. If replicated by other studies, these findings would add to the evidence on the potential for climate 
change to alter indoor air quality and further emphasize the impact of indoor air sources on human health. The 
overall implications of these findings for exposure to ambient and indoor air pollution remain uncertain at present, as 
they need to be considered along with other determinants of air exchange, such as window-opening behavior, whose 
relationship with climate change remains poorly characterized.

entering a building reacts with some organic compounds to 
produce secondary indoor air pollutants. These reactions lower 
indoor ozone concentrations but introduce new indoor air con­
taminants, including other respiratory irritants.135 
Climate-related increases in droughts and dust storms may 
result in increases in indoor transmission of dust-borne patho­
gens, as the dust penetrates the indoor environment. Dust con­
tains particles of biologic origin, including pollen and bacterial 
and fungal spores. Some of the particles are allergenic.136 Patho­
genic fungi and bacteria can be found in dust both indoors and 
outdoors.137 For example, in the southwestern United States, 
spores from the fungi Coccidiodes, which can cause valley fever, 
are found indoors.138 The geographic range where Coccidiodes 
is commonly found is increasing. Climate changes, including 
increases in droughts and temperatures, may be contributing 
to this spread and to a rise in valley fever (see Ch. 4: Extreme 
Events).
Legionnaires’ disease is primarily contracted from aerosolized 
water contaminated with Legionella bacteria.139 Legionella 
bacteria are naturally found outdoors in water and soil; they are 
also known to contaminate treated water systems in build­
ings,140 as well as building cooling systems such as swamp cool­
ers or cooling towers.141 Legionella can also be found indoors 
inside plumbing fixtures such as showerheads, faucets, and 
humidifiers.142, 143 Legionella can cause outbreaks of a pneumo­
nia known as Legionnaire’s disease, which is a potentially fatal 
infection.144 Exposure can occur indoors when a spray or mist 
of contaminated water is inhaled, including mist or spray from 
showers and swamp coolers.145 The spread of Legionella bacte­
ria can be affected by regional environmental factors.116 Legion­
naires’ disease is known to follow a seasonal pattern, with more 
cases in late summer and autumn, potentially due to warmer 
and damper conditions.146, 147 Cases of Legionnaires’ disease are 
rising in the United States, with an increase of 192% from 2000 
to 2009.148, 149 If climate change results in sustained higher tem­
peratures and damper conditions in some areas, there could be 
increases in the spread and transmission of Legionella. 
Contaminants Generated Indoors
Although research directly linking indoor dampness and climate 
change is not available, information on building science, climate 
change, and outdoor environmental factors that affect indoor 
air quality can be used to project how climate change may 
influence indoor environments.130 Climate change could result 
in increased indoor dampness in at least two ways: 1) if there 
are more frequent heavy precipitation events and other severe 
weather events (including high winds, flooding, and winter 
storms) that result in damage to buildings, allowing water or 
moisture entry; and 2) if outdoor humidity rises with climate 
change, indoor humidity and the potential for condensation 
and dampness will likely rise. Outdoor humidity is usually the 
largest contributor to indoor dampness on a yearly basis.127 
Increased indoor dampness and humidity will in turn increase 
indoor mold, dust mites, bacteria, and other bio-contamination 
indoors, as well as increase levels of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) and other chemicals resulting from the off-gassing of 
damp or wet building materials.116, 119, 150 Dampness and mold 
in U.S. homes are linked to approximately 4.6 million cases of 
worsened asthma and between 8% and 20% of several common 
respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis.151, 152 If there are 
climate-induced rises in indoor dampness, there could be in­
creases in adverse health effects related to dampness and mold, 
such as asthma exacerbation. 
Additionally, power outages due to more frequent extreme 
weather events such as flooding could lead to a number of 
health effects (see Ch 4: Extreme Events). Heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems will not function without 
power; therefore, many buildings could have difficulty main­
taining indoor temperatures or humidity. Loss of ventilation, 
filtration, air circulation, and humidity control can lead to indoor 
mold growth and increased levels of indoor contaminants,153 
including VOCs such as formaldehyde.119, 154, 155, 156 Power outages 
are also associated with increases in hospital visits from carbon 
monoxide (CO) poisoning, primarily due to the incorrect use 
of backup and portable generators that contaminate indoor 
air with carbon monoxide.135 Following floods, CO poisoning is 
also associated with the improper indoor use of wood-burning 
appliances and other combustion appliances designed for use 
outdoors.157 There were at least nine deaths from carbon mon­
oxide poisoning related to power outages from 2000 to 2009.158
Climate factors can influence populations of rodents that pro­
duce allergens and can harbor pathogens such as hantaviruses, 
which can cause Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. Hantavirus­
es can be spread to people by rodents that infest buildings,159 
and limiting indoor exposure is a key strategy to prevent the 
spread of hantavirus.160 Climate change may increase rodent 
populations in some areas, including indoors, particularly when 
droughts are followed by periods of heavy rain (see Ch. 4: Ex­
treme Events) and with increases in temperature and rainfall.161 
Also, extreme weather events such as heavy rains and flooding 
may drive some rodents to relocate indoors.162 Increases in 
rodent populations may result in increased indoor exposures to 
rodent allergens and related health effects.159, 163, 164 In addition, 
climate factors may also influence the prevalence of hantavirus­
es in rodents.163, 164 This is a complex dynamic, because climate 
change may influence rodent populations, ranges, and infection 
rates.

3.5	 Populations of Concern
Certain groups of people may be more susceptible to 
harm from air pollution due to factors including age, 
access to healthcare, baseline health status, or other 
characteristics.60 In the contiguous United States, Blacks 
or African-Americans, women, and the elderly expe­
rience the greatest baseline risk from air pollution.165 
The young, older adults, asthmatics, and people whose 
immune systems are compromised are more vulnerable 
to indoor air pollutants than the general population.166 
Lower 
socioeconomic status and housing disrepair have been 
associated with higher indoor allergen exposures, 
though higher-income populations may be more ex­
posed to certain allergens such as dust mites.167, 168 
Nearly 6.8 million children in the United States are 
affected by asthma, making it a major chronic disease 
of childhood.169 It is also the main cause of school 
absenteeism and hospital admissions among children.83 
In 2008, 9.3% of American children age 2 to 17 years 
were reported to have asthma.169 The onset of asthma 
in children has been linked to early allergen exposure 
and viral infections, which act in concert with genetic 
susceptibility.170 Children can be particularly suscepti­
ble to allergens due to their immature respiratory and 
immune systems, as well as indoor or outdoor activities 
that contribute to aeroallergen exposure (see Table 
1).170, 171, 172, 173 
Minority adults and children also bear a dispropor­
tionate burden associated with asthma as measured 
by emergency department visits, lost work and school 
days, and overall poorer health status (see Table 1).175, 176 
Twice as many Black children had asthma-related emer­
gency department visits and hospitalizations compared 
with White children. Fewer Black and Hispanic children 
reported using preventative medication like inhaled cor­
ticosteroids (ICS) as compared to White children. Black 
and Hispanic children also had more poorly controlled 
asthma symptoms, leading to increased emergency 
department visits and greater use of rescue medications 
rather than routine daily use of ICS, regardless of symp­
tom control.173, 177
Children living in poverty were 1.75 times more likely to 
be hospitalized for asthma than their non-poor counterparts. 
When income is accounted for, no significant difference was 
observed in the rate of hospital admissions by race or ethnicity. 
This income effect may be related to access and use of health 
care and appropriate use of preventive medications such as 
ICS.178

Table 1: A recent study of children in California found that racial 
and ethnic minorities are more affected by asthma.175 Among 
minority children, the prevalence of asthma varies with the high­
est rates among Blacks and American Indians/Alaska Natives 
(17%), followed by non-Hispanic or non-Latino Whites (10%), 
Hispanics (7%), and Asian Americans (7%).
People with preexisting medical conditions—including hy­
pertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disorder—are at greater risk for outdoor air pollution-related 
health effects than the general population.179 Populations with 
irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation) who were exposed to air 
pollution and high temperatures experience increased risk.165 
People who live or work in buildings without air conditioning 
and other ventilation controls or in buildings that are unable to 
withstand extreme precipitation or flooding events are at great­

er risk of adverse health effects. Other health risks are related to 
exposures to poor indoor air quality from mold and other bio­
logical contaminants and chemical pollutants emitted from wet 
building materials. While the presence of air conditioning has 
been found to greatly reduce the risk of ozone-related deaths, 
communities with a higher percentage of unemployment and a 
greater population of Blacks are at greater risk.59
3.6	 Research Needs
In addition to the emerging issues identified above, the 
authors highlight the following potential areas for additional 
scientific and research activity on air quality. Understanding of 
future air quality and the ability to model future health im­
pacts associated with air quality changes—particularly PM2.5 
impacts—will be enhanced by improved modeling and projec­
tions of climate-dependent variables like wildfires and land-use 
patterns, as well as improved modeling of ecosystem responses 
to climate change. Improved collection of data on aeroallergen 
concentrations in association with other ecosystem variables 
will facilitate research and modeling of related health impacts.   
Future assessments can benefit from research activities that:
•	 enhance understanding of how interactions among cli­
mate-related factors, such as temperature or relative humid­
ity, aeroallergens, and air pollution, affect human health, and 
how to attribute health impacts to changes in these different 
risk factors;
•	 improve the ability to model and project climate change 
impacts on the formation and fate of air contaminants and 
quantify the compounded uncertainty in the projections; and
•	 identify the impacts of changes in indoor dampness, such as 
mold, other biological contaminants, volatile organic com­
pounds, and indoor air chemistry on indoor air pollutants and 
health.

Supporting Evidence
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING CHAPTER
The chapter was developed through technical discussions 
of relevant evidence and expert deliberation by the report 
authors at several workshops, teleconferences, and email 
exchanges. The authors considered inputs and comments 
submitted by the public, the National Academies of Sciences, 
and Federal agencies. For additional information on the 
overall report process, see Appendices 2 and 3.
In addition, the author team held an all-day meeting at 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Center 
for Environmental Assessment in Crystal City, Virginia, 
on October 15, 2014, to discuss the chapter and develop 
initial drafts of the Key Findings. A quorum of the authors 
participated and represented each of the three sections of 
the chapter—outdoor air quality, aeroallergens, and indoor 
air quality. These discussions were informed by the results 
of the literature review as well as the research highlights 
focused on outdoor air quality and indoor air quality. The 
team developed Key Finding 2 in response to comments from 
the National Research Council review panel and the general 
public.
The Key Findings for outdoor ozone, wildfires, and 
aeroallergen impacts reflect strong empirical evidence linking 
changes in climate to these outcomes. When characterizing 
the human health impacts from outdoor ozone, the team 
considered the strength of the toxicological, clinical, and 
epidemiological evidence evaluated in the Ozone Integrated 
Science Assessment.39 Because there is increasing evidence 
that climate change will increase the frequency and intensity 
of wildfire events, this outcome was included as a key finding, 
despite the inability to quantify this impact with the available 
tools and data. Because altered patterns of precipitation 
and increasing levels of CO2 are anticipated to promote the 
level of aeroallergens, this outcome is also included as a 
Key Finding. Finally, because the empirical evidence linking 
climate change to indoor air quality was more equivocal, we 
identified this topic as an emerging issue. 
KEY FINDING TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS
Exacerbated Ozone Health Impacts
Key Finding 1: Climate change will make it harder for any 
given regulatory approach to reduce ground-level ozone 
pollution in the future as meteorological conditions become 
increasingly conducive to forming ozone over most of the 
United States [Likely, High Confidence]. Unless offset by 
additional emissions reductions of ozone precursors, these 
climate-driven increases in ozone will cause premature 
deaths, hospital visits, lost school days, and acute respiratory 
symptoms [Likely, High Confidence].
Description of evidence base
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
has concluded that warming of the global climate system 
is unequivocal and that continued increases in greenhouse 
gas emissions will cause further temperature increases.5, 
35 At the same time, there is a well-established relationship 
between measured temperature and monitored peak ozone 
levels in the United States.1, 25 Numerous climate and air 
quality modeling studies have also confirmed that increasing 
temperatures, along with other changes in meteorological 
variables, are likely to lead to higher peak ozone levels in the 
future over the United States,7, 37 if ozone precursor emissions 
remain unchanged.
Risk assessments using concentration–response relationships 
from the epidemiological literature and modeled air quality 
data have projected substantial health impacts associated 
with climate-induced changes in air quality.14, 42, 43, 44, 46, 50 This 
literature reports a range of potential changes in ozone-
related, non-accidental mortality due to modeled climate 
change between the present and 2030 or 2050, depending 
upon the scenario modeled, the climate and air quality 
models used, and assumptions about the concentration–
response function and future populations. Many of the 
studies suggest that tens to thousands of premature deaths 
could occur in the future due to climate change impacts on 
air quality.14, 42 At the same time, hundreds of thousands of 
days of missed school and hundreds of thousands to millions 
of cases of acute respiratory symptoms also result from the 
climate-driven ozone increases in the United States.14
Major uncertainties
Climate projections are driven by greenhouse gas emission 
scenarios, which vary substantially depending on assumptions 
for economic growth and climate change mitigation policies. 
There is significant internal variability in the climate system, 
which leads to additional uncertainties in climate projections, 
particularly on a regional basis. Ozone concentrations also 
depend on emissions that are influenced indirectly by climate 
change (for example, incidence of wildfires, changes in energy 
use, energy technology choices), which further compounds 
the uncertainty. Studies projecting human health impacts 
apply concentration–response relationships from existing 
epidemiological studies characterizing historical air quality 
changes; it is unclear how future changes in the relationship 
between air quality, population exposure, and baseline 
health may affect the concentration–response relationship. 
Finally, these studies do not account for the possibility 
of a physiological interaction between air pollutants and 
temperature, which could lead to increases or decreases in air 
pollution-related deaths and illnesses.

Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
Given the known relationship between temperature and 
ozone, as well as the numerous air quality modeling studies 
that suggest climate-driven meteorological changes will 
yield conditions more favorable for ozone formation in the 
future, there is high confidence that ozone levels will likely 
increase due to climate change, unless offset by reductions in 
ozone precursor emissions. Based on observed relationships 
between ozone concentrations and human health responses, 
there is high confidence that any climate-driven increases 
in ozone will likely cause additional cases of premature 
mortality, as well as increasingly frequent cases of hospital 
visits and lost school days due to respiratory impacts. 
Increased Health Impacts from Wildfires
Key Finding 2: Wildfires emit fine particles and ozone 
precursors that in turn increase the risk of premature death 
and adverse chronic and acute cardiovascular and respiratory 
health outcomes [Likely, High Confidence]. Climate change 
is projected to increase the number and severity of naturally 
occurring wildfires in parts of the United States, increasing 
emissions of particulate matter and ozone precursors and 
resulting in additional adverse health outcomes [Likely, High 
Confidence].     
Description of evidence base
The harmful effects of PM concentrations on human health 
have been well-documented, and there is equally strong 
evidence linking wildfires to higher PM concentrations 
regionally. Recent studies have established linkages between 
wildfire incidence and adverse health outcomes in the nearby 
population.70, 71 Though projections of climate change impacts 
on precipitation patterns are less certain than those on 
temperature, there is greater agreement across models that 
precipitation will decrease in the western United States.74 
Rising temperatures, decreasing precipitation, and earlier 
springtime onset of snowmelt are projected to lead to 
increased frequency and severity of wildfires.22, 75, 77
Major uncertainties
Future climate projections, especially projections of 
precipitation, are subject to considerable uncertainty. Land 
management practices, including possible adaptive measures 
taken to mitigate risk, could alter the frequency and severity 
of wildfires, the emissions from wildfires, and the associated 
human exposure to smoke.
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
Given the known association between PM and health 
outcomes and between wildfires and PM concentrations, 
there is high confidence that an increase in wildfire frequency  
and severity will likely lead to an increase in adverse 
respiratory and cardiac health outcomes. Based on the 
robustness of the projection by global climate models that 
precipitation amounts will decrease in parts of the United 
States, and that summer temperatures will increase, there is 
high confidence that the frequency and severity of wildfire 
occurrence will likely increase, particularly in the western 
United States.
Worsened Allergy and Asthma Conditions 
Key Finding 3: Changes in climate, specifically rising 
temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increasing 
concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, are expected 
to contribute to increases in the levels of some airborne 
allergens and associated increases in asthma episodes and 
other allergic illnesses [High Confidence]. 
Description of evidence base
There is a large body of evidence supporting the observation 
that climate change will alter the production, allergenicity, 
distribution, and timing of aeroallergens. Historical trends 
show that climate change has led to changes in the length 
of the growing season for certain allergenic pollens. Climate 
change also contributes to changes in allergic illnesses 
as greater concentrations of CO2, together with higher 
temperatures and changes in precipitation, extend the start 
or duration of the growing season, increase the quantity and 
allergenicity of pollen, and expand the spatial distribution of 
pollens.84, 91, 92, 93, 94 While the role of weather on the initiation 
or exacerbation of allergic symptoms in sensitive persons 
is not entirely understood,86, 107 increases in intensity and 
frequency of rainfall and storminess over the coming decades 
is expected to be associated with spikes in aeroallergen 
concentrations and the potential for related increases in the 
number and severity of allergic illnesses.108, 109 
These changes in exposure to aeroallergens contribute to 
the severity and prevalence of allergic disease in humans. 
Given that aeroallergen exposure is not the sole, or even 
necessarily the most significant, factor associated with 
allergic illnesses, that relationship is part of a complex 
pathway that links exposure to aeroallergens to the 
prevalence of allergic illnesses.81 There is consistent and 
robust evidence that aeroallergen exposure contributes 
significantly to the occurrence of asthma episodes, hay fever, 
sinusitis, conjunctivitis, hives, and anaphylaxis.84, 88 There is 
also compelling evidence that allergic diseases develop in 
response to complex and multiple interactions among both 
genetic and non-genetic factors, including a developing 
immune system, environmental exposures (such as ambient 
air pollution or weather conditions), and socioeconomic and 
demographic factors.85, 86, 87 Finally, there is evidence that 
potential non-linear interactions between aeroallergens and 
ambient air pollutants is likely to increase health risks for 
people who are simultaneously exposed.87, 88, 106, 108, 110, 111, 112, 
113, 114
Major uncertainties
The interrelationships between climate variability and 
change and exposure to aeroallergens are complex. Where

they exist, differences in findings from across the relevant 
scientific literature may be due to study designs, references 
to certain species of pollen, geographic characteristics, 
climate variables, and degree of allergy sensitization.104 
There are also uncertainties with respect to the role of 
climate change and the extent and nature of its effects as 
they contribute to aeroallergen-related diseases, especially 
asthma.91 Existing uncertainties can be addressed through 
the development of standardized approaches for measuring 
exposures and tracking outcomes across a range of allergic 
illnesses, vulnerable populations, and geographic proximity to 
exposures.82
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence 
The scientific literature suggests that there is high confidence 
that changes in climate, including rising temperatures and 
altered precipitation patterns, will affect the concentration, 
allergenicity, season length, and spatial distribution of a 
number of aeroallergens, and these changes are expected 
to impact the prevalence of some allergic diseases, including 
asthma attacks.
DOCUMENTING UNCERTAINTY
This assessment relies on two metrics to communicate 
the degree of certainty in Key Findings. See Appendix 4: 
Documenting Uncertainty for more on assessments of 
likelihood and confidence.

Key Findings
Increased Exposure to Extreme Events
Key Finding 1: Health impacts associated with climate-related changes in exposure to extreme events include 
death, injury, or illness; exacerbation of underlying medical conditions; and adverse effects on mental health 
[High Confidence]. Climate change will increase exposure risk in some regions of the United States due to 
projected increases in the frequency and/or intensity of drought, wildfires, and flooding related to extreme 
precipitation and hurricanes [Medium Confidence].
Disruption of Essential Infrastructure
Key Finding 2: Many types of extreme events related to climate change cause disruption of infrastructure, 
including power, water, transportation, and communication systems, that are essential to maintaining access 
to health care and emergency response services and safeguarding human health [High Confidence].
Vulnerability to Coastal Flooding
Key Finding 3: Coastal populations with greater vulnerability to health impacts from coastal flooding include 
persons with disabilities or other access and functional needs, certain populations of color, older adults, 
pregnant women and children, low-income populations, and some occupational groups [High Confidence]. 
Climate change will increase exposure risk to coastal flooding due to increases in extreme precipitation and 
in hurricane intensity and rainfall rates, as well as sea level rise and the resulting increases in storm surge 
[High Confidence].

4.1	 Introduction
Some regions of the United States have already experienced 
costly impacts—in terms of both lives lost and economic dam­
ages—from observed changes in the frequency, intensity, or 
duration of certain extreme events (Figure 1). Climate change 
projections show that there will be continuing increases in the 
occurrence and severity of some extreme events by the end 
of the century, while for other extremes the links to climate 
change are more uncertain (Table 1). (See also Ch. 1: Introduc­
tion)
Four categories of extreme events with important health 
impacts in the United States are addressed in this chapter: 1) 
flooding related to extreme precipitation, hurricanes, and coast­
al storms, 2) droughts, 3) wildfires, and 4) winter storms and 
severe thunderstorms. The health impacts of extreme heat and 
extreme cold are discussed in Chapter 2: Temperature-Related 
Death and Illness. For each event type, the chapter integrates 
discussion of populations of concern that have greater vulner­
ability to adverse health outcomes. The air quality impacts of 
wildfires are discussed below and also in Chapter 3: Air Quality 
Impacts. Although mental health effects are noted briefly here 
and in later sections of this chapter, in-depth discussion of the 
impacts of extreme events on mental health is presented in 
Chapter 8: Mental Health.
While it is intuitive that extremes can have health impacts 
such as death or injury during an event (for example, drowning 
during floods), health impacts can also occur before or after 
an extreme event as individuals may be involved in activities 
that put their health at risk, such as disaster preparation and 
post-event cleanup.1 Health risks may also arise long after the 
event, or in places outside the area where the event took place, 
as a result of damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of 
infrastructure and public services, social and economic impacts, 
environmental degradation, and other factors. Extreme events 
also pose unique health risks if multiple events occur simulta­
neously or in succession in a given location, but these issues of 
cumulative or compounding impacts are still emerging in the 
literature (see Front Matter and Ch. 1: Introduction).
Dynamic interactions between extreme events, their physical 
impacts, and population vulnerability and response can make 
it difficult to quantitatively measure all the health impacts 
that may be associated with an extreme event type, partic­
ularly those that are distributed over longer periods of time 
(See “Emerging Issues,” Section 4.8). These complexities make 
it difficult to integrate human health outcomes into climate 
impact models, and thus projections of future health burdens 
due to extreme events under climate change are not available 
Figure 1: This figure provides 10-year estimates of fatalities related to extreme events from 2004 to 2013,204 as well as estimated 
economic damages from 58 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion (see Smith and Katz 2013 to 
understand how total losses were calculated).205 These statistics are indicative of the human and economic costs of extreme weather 
events over this time period. Climate change will alter the frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution of some of these extremes,2 
which has consequences for exposure to health risks from extreme events. Trends and future projections for some extremes, 
including tornadoes, lightning, and wind storms are still uncertain.

Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over 
the last three to five decades, with the largest increases in 
the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in the frequency and 
intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all 
U.S. regions. [High Confidence].
The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic 
hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest 
hurricanes, have all increased since the 1980s [High 
Confidence]. Hurricane intensity and rainfall are projected 
to increase as the climate continues to warm [Medium 
Confidence].
Increasing severity and frequency of flooding have been 
observed throughout much of the Mississippi and Missouri 
River Basins. Increased flood frequency and severity 
are projected in the Northeast and Midwest regions [Low 
Confidence]. In the Western United States, increasing 
snowmelt and rain-on-snow events (increased runoff when 
rain falls onto existing snowpack) will increase flooding in 
some mountain watersheds [Medium Confidence].
In the next several decades, storm surges and high tides 
could combine with sea level rise and land subsidence to 
further increase coastal flooding in many regions. The U.S. 
East and Gulf Coasts, Hawaii, and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific 
Islands are particularly at risk. 
Droughts
•	 Reduced water quality and 
quantity
•	 Respiratory impacts related to 
reduced air quality
•	 Mental health impacts
Over the last several decades, drought patterns and trends 
have been changing, but patterns vary regionally across the 
United States. Droughts in the Southwest are projected to 
become more intense [High Confidence].
Wildfires
•	 Smoke inhalation
•	 Burns and other traumatic injury 
•	 Asthma exacerbations 
•	 Mental health impacts 
Increased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all 
caused by or linked to climate change, have increased 
wildfires and impacts to people and ecosystems in the 
Southwest [High Confidence]. 
Rising temperatures and hotter, drier summers are projected 
to increase the frequency and intensity of large wildfires, 
particularly in the western United States and Alaska. 
Winter Storms & 
Severe Thunderstorms 
•	 Traumatic injury and death
•	 Carbon monoxide poisoning 
related to power outages
•	 Hypothermia and frostbite 
•	 Mental health impacts
Winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity 
since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward 
[Medium Confidence]. Future trends in severe storms, 
including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and 
damaging thunderstorm winds, are uncertain and are being 
studied intensively [Low Confidence].

in the literature. Instead, this chapter focuses on explaining the 
physical processes and pathways that scientists know contribute 
to human exposure and identifying overarching conclusions re­
garding the risk of adverse health impacts as a result of chang­
ing extreme weather and climate.
4.2	 Complex Factors Determine Health Impacts 
The severity and extent of health effects associated with ex­
treme events depend on the physical impacts of the extreme 
events themselves as well as the unique human, societal, and 
environmental circumstances at the time and place where 
events occur. This complex set of factors can moderate or 
exacerbate health outcomes and vulnerability in the affected 
people and communities (Figure 2). Vulnerability is the ten­
dency or predisposition to be adversely affected by climate-re­
lated health effects. It encompasses three elements—expo­
sure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity—that also interact 
with and are influenced by the social determinants of health 
(See Ch. 1: Introduction and Ch. 9: Populations of Concern for 
additional discussion and definitions of these terms.) 
Exposure is contact between a person and one or more bio­
logical, psychosocial, chemical, or physical stressors, including 
stressors affected by climate change. Contact may occur in a 
single instance or repeatedly over time, and may occur in one 
location or over a wider geographic area. Demographic shifts 
and population migration may change exposure to public 
health impacts. For example, since 1970, coastal population 
growth (39%) has substantially increased compared to popula­
tion growth for the United States as a whole (about 13%).3 In 
the future, this coastal migration in conjunction with rising sea 
levels has the potential to result in increased vulnerability to 
storm surge events for a greater proportion of the U.S. popu­
lation concentrated in these coastal areas. Choices by individ­
uals and governments can reduce or increase some exposure 
risk to extreme events.4 As shown in Figure 2, such choices 
can include whether to build or allow development in flood­
plains and coastal areas subject to extreme high tides and 
sea level rise. Individuals’ responses to evacuation orders and 
other emergency warnings also affect their exposure to health 
threats. Factors such as income have been linked to how peo­
ple perceive the risks to which they are exposed and choose 
Figure 2: This conceptual diagram for a flooding event illustrates the key pathways by which humans are exposed to health threats 
from climate drivers, and potential resulting health outcomes (center boxes). These exposure pathways exist within the context of 
other factors that positively or negatively influence health outcomes (gray side boxes). Key factors that influence health outcomes and 
vulnerability for individuals are shown in the right box, and include social determinants of health and behavioral choices. Key factors 
that influence health outcomes and vulnerability at larger community or societal scales, such as natural and built environments, 
governance and management, and institutions, are shown in the left box. All of these influencing factors may also be affected by 
climate change. See Chapter 1: Introduction for more information.

to respond, as well as their ability to evacuate or relocate to 
a less risk-prone location.5 The condition of the built environ­
ment also affects exposure to extreme events, and those living 
in low-quality, poorly maintained, or high-density housing may 
have greater risks of health impacts.6 
Sensitivity is the degree to which people or communities are 
affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability 
and change. It is determined, at least in part, by biologically 
based traits such as age. For example, older adults (generally 
defined as age 65 and older) are physiologically more sensitive 
to health impacts from extreme events because of normal 
aging processes; they are generally more frail, more likely to 
have chronic medical conditions that make them more depen­
dent on medications, and require more assistance in activities 
of daily living.7, 8 In addition, social determinants of health 
affect disparities in the prevalence of medical conditions that 
contribute to biological sensitivity.9, 10 Health disparities are 
more prevalent in low-income populations, as well as in some 
communities of color, and are frequently exacerbated during 
extreme events.11 For example, Black or African American 
populations have higher rates of chronic conditions such as 
asthma, decreased lung function, and cardiovascular issues, all 
of which are known to increase sensitivity to health effects of 
smoke from wildfires  (Ch. 3: Air Quality Impacts).12
Adaptive capacity is the ability of communities, institutions, 
or people to adjust to potential hazards, to take advantage of 
opportunities, or to respond to 
consequences. Having strong 
adaptive capacity contributes to 
resilience—the ability to prepare 
and plan for, absorb, recover 
from, and more successfully 
adapt to adverse events.13 In 
the context of extreme events, 
people with low adaptive capac­
ity have difficulty responding, evacuating, or relocating when 
necessary, and recovering from event-related health impacts. 
For individuals, health outcomes are strongly influenced by the 
social determinants of health that affect a person’s adaptive 
capacity. Poverty is a key risk factor, and the poor are dispropor­
tionately affected by extreme events.4, 9, 14 Low-income individ­
uals may have fewer financial resources and social capital (such 
as human networks and relationships) to help them prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from an extreme event.15, 16 In many 
urban, low-income neighborhoods, adaptive capacity is reduced 
where physical and social constructs, such as community infra­
structure, neighborhood cohesion, and social patterns, promote 
social isolation.17, 18, 19 Those with higher income possess a much 
higher level of resilience and availability of resources to increase 
their adaptive capacity.20, 21 Other attributes of individuals that 
contribute to lower adaptive capacity include their age (very 
young or very old) and associated dependency on caregivers, 
disabilities such as mobility or cognitive impairments, having 
specific access and functional needs, medical or chemical de­
pendence, limited English proficiency, social or cultural isola­
tion, homelessness, and institutionalization (prisons, psychiatric 
facilities, nursing homes).1, 8, 22 
At a larger community or societal level, adaptive capacity is 
heavily influenced by governance, management, and institu­
tions.23 Governments and non-governmental organizations 
provide essential extreme-event preparedness, coordination, 
emergency response, and recovery functions that increase 
adaptive capacity at the local, state, tribal, and federal levels—
for example, in providing early warning systems where possi­
ble, evacuation assistance, and disaster relief.13, 24 Risk sharing, 
management, and recovery schemes such as insurance can 
also play a significant role in 
building resilience in the context 
of extreme events and climate 
change.25, 26 For instance, lack of 
health insurance has been asso­
ciated with greater risk of hospi­
tal admission after exposure to 
certain weather events.27 Public 
health actions or interventions 
that maintain or strengthen the adaptive capacity of com­
munities, institutions, or people could help mediate certain 
health impacts due to extreme events.28 On the other hand, 
climate change—particularly its effect on extreme events—has 
the potential to create unanticipated public health stressors 
that could overwhelm the U.S. public health system’s adaptive 
capacity and could require new approaches.28 
4.3	 Disruption of Essential Infrastructure
When essential infrastructure and related services are disrupt­
ed during and after an extreme event, a population’s exposure 
to health hazards can increase, and losses related to the event 
can reduce adaptive capacity.4 Disruptions can include reduced 
functionality, such as poor road conditions that limit travel, or 
complete loss of infrastructure, such as roads and bridges being 
washed away. Serious health risks can arise from infrastructure 
and housing damage and disruption or loss of access to electric­
ity, sanitation, safe food and water supplies, health care, com­

Having strong adaptive capacity contributes 
to resilience—the ability to prepare and plan 
for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully 
adapt to adverse events.

munication, and transportation.1, 29, 30, 31, 32 Identifying vulnerable 
infrastructure and investing in strategies to reduce vulnerability, 
including redundancy (having additional or alternate systems in 
place as backup) and ensuring a certain standard of condition 
and performance can reduce the likelihood of significant ad­
verse impacts to infrastructure from extreme weather events.33
Health Risks Related to Infrastructure
Existing infrastructure is generally designed to perform at its 
engineered capacity assuming historical weather patterns, and 
these systems could be more vulnerable to failure in response 
to weather-related stressors under future climate scenarios.4, 
34, 35 Shifts in the frequency or intensity of extreme events out­
side their historical range pose infrastructure risks, which may 
be compounded by the fact that much of the existing critical 
infrastructure in the United States, like water and sewage sys­
tems, roads, bridges, and power plants, are aging and in need 
of repair or replacement.4, 36 For example, the 2013 American 
Society of Civil Engineer’s Report Card assigned a letter grade 
of D+ to the condition and performance of the Nation’s infra­
structure.37 
In addition, recurrent weather-related stressors, such as “nui­
sance flooding” (frequent coastal flooding that is increasing in 
frequency due to sea level rise), contribute to overall dete­
rioration of infrastructure like stormwater drainage systems 
and roads (see Ch. 6: Water-Related Illness).38 These systems 
are important in the context of health because drainage helps 
to avoid sewage overflows and maintain water quality,39 and 
roads are vital for evacuations and emergency response during 
and after extreme events.40 
Energy infrastructure that relies on environmental inputs, such 
as water for cooling in power generation or for hydroelectric 
dams, is also vulnerable to changes in extreme events due 
to climate change.34, 41 Power generation accounts for one of 
the largest withdrawals of freshwater in the United States.42 
Longer or more intense droughts that are projected for some 
regions of the United States (see Table 1) will contribute to 
reduced energy production in those regions, which may lead 
to supply interruptions of varying lengths and magnitudes 
and adverse impacts to other infrastructure that depends on 
energy supply.34 
Power Outages
Electricity is fundamental to much modern infrastructure, 
and power outages are commonly associated with the types 
of extreme events highlighted in this chapter.43 During power 
outages, observed health impacts include increased deaths 
from accidental and natural causes,44 increased cases of food­
borne diarrheal illness from consuming food spoiled by lack 
of refrigeration (see Ch. 7: Food Safety),1 and increased rates 
of hospitalization.45 In addition, extreme-event-related power 
outages are associated with increased injuries and deaths 
from carbon monoxide poisoning after floods, hurricanes, 
severe winter storms, and ice storms.1, 31, 46, 47, 48, 49 This is due to 
increased use of gasoline-powered generators, charcoal grills, 
and kerosene and propane heaters or stoves inside the home 
or other areas without proper ventilation (see also Ch. 3: Air 
Quality Impacts). Populations considered especially vulnerable 
to the health impacts of power outages include older adults, 
young children, those reliant on electrically powered medical 
equipment like ventilators and oxygen, those with preexisting 
health conditions, and those with disabilities (see Ch. 9: Pop­
ulations of Concern).1, 43, 44 In rural communities, power and 
communications can take longer to restore after damage from 
an extreme event.50
Transportation, Communication, and Access 
Damage to transportation infrastructure or difficult road 
conditions may delay first responders, potentially delaying 
treatment of acute injuries and requiring more serious inter­
vention or hospitalization.40 Extreme events can disrupt access 
to health care services via damage to or loss of transportation 
infrastructure, evacuation, and population displacement.32 
For chronically ill people, treatment interruptions and lack of 
access to medication can exacerbate health conditions both 
during and after the extreme event.1, 51 Surveys of patients 
after Hurricane Katrina showed that those with cancer, hy­
pertension, kidney disease requiring dialysis, cardiovascular 
disease, and respiratory illnesses were particularly affected.51, 
52, 53 Evacuations also pose health risks to older adults—espe­
cially those who are frail, medically incapacitated, or residing 
in nursing or assisted living facilities—and may be complicated 
by the need for concurrent transfer of medical records, med­
ications, and medical equipment.1, 54 Some individuals with 
disabilities may also be disproportionally affected during evac­
uations if they are unable to access evacuation routes, have 
difficulty in understanding or receiving warnings of impending 
danger, or have limited ability to communicate their needs.55

In addition, persons with limited English proficiency are less 
likely to understand or have timely access to emergency 
information, which may lead to delayed evacuation.56, 57 Health 
risks increase if evacuation is delayed until after a storm hits; 
loss of power and damage to communications and transporta­
tion infrastructure can hinder health system operations.1 
Water Infrastructure
Extreme precipitation events and storms can overwhelm or 
damage stormwater and wastewater treatment infrastructure, 
increasing the risk of exposure to contaminated water (see Ch. 
6: Water-Related Illness). Risk of post-flood gastrointestinal ill­
ness outbreaks are considered to be low in the United States, 
but risk increases for displaced populations—especially young 
children and infants with immature immune systems—where 
shelter conditions are crowded or have poor sanitation.1, 29 
There is potential for post-flood mold and fungi growth inside 
houses to worsen allergic and asthmatic symptoms, but these 
types of health impacts have not been documented following 
floods or storms.1, 29, 58, 59 In general, however, adverse health 
effects from dampness and mold in homes are well known and 
studied.60, 61, 62
Cascading Failures
Many infrastructure systems are reliant on one another, 
and disruption or failure of one system or at any place in 
the system can lead to the disruption of interconnected 
systems—a phenomenon referred to as a cascading failure. 
For example, electricity is essential to multiple systems, and 
a failure in the electrical grid can have cascading effects on 
water and sewage treatment, transportation, and health care 
systems.36, 43 Extreme events can simultaneously strain single 
or multiple components of interconnected infrastructure and 
related facilities and equipment, which increases the risk of 
cascading infrastructure failure.63, 64 This risk to interconnected 
systems has been particularly notable in the context of urban 
areas (especially cities for which the design or maintenance 
of critical infrastructure needs improvement) and industrial 
sites containing chemicals or hazardous materials that rely 
on specific equipment—such as holding tanks, pipelines, and 
electricity-dependent safety mechanisms like automatic shut-
off valves—to prevent releases.4, 65, 66 Dramatic infrastructure 
system failures are rare, but such cascading failures can lead 
to public health consequences when they do occur, including 
shifts in disease incidence.67 
The 2003 blackout in the northeastern United States, caused 
indirectly by surging electrical demand during a heat wave, is 
an illustrative example of how climate change could introduce 
or exacerbate health threats from cascading infrastructure 
failures related to extreme weather. During this 31-hour event, 
lack of electricity compromised traffic control, health care and 
emergency services, wastewater treatment, solid waste col­
lection, and a host of other critical infrastructure operations.68, 
69, 70, 71 New York City health officials responded to failure of 
hospital emergency generators and interruptions in electrically 
powered medical equipment, contamination of recreational 
water and beaches with untreated sewage, pest control issues, 
and loss of refrigeration leading to potential impacts on food 
and vaccine spoilage.72 Increased incidence of gastrointestinal 
illness from contaminated food or water, and a large increase 
in accidental and non-accidental deaths and hospitalizations 
in New York City were attributed to the blackout.44, 45, 72 See 
Chapter 6: Water-Related Illness for other examples of health 
impacts when interconnected wastewater, stormwater, and 
drinking water infrastructure fails, such as during the 1993 
Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak. 
4.4	 Flooding Related to Extreme Precipitation,
Hurricanes, and Coastal Storms
Floods are the primary health hazard associated with extreme 
precipitation events, hurricanes, and coastal storms. Risk of 
exposure to floods varies by region in the United States and 
by type of flooding that occurs in that location (see Table 1 
and “Flood Terminology”). People in flood-prone regions are 
expected to be at greater risk of exposure to flood hazards due 
to climate change (Table 1),9, 73, 74 which may result in various 
types of health impacts described below.
Most flood deaths in the United States are due to drowning 
associated with flash flooding.1, 29, 58 The majority of these 
deaths are associated with becoming stranded or swept away 
when driving or walking near or through floodwaters.58, 76, 77, 
78 Flash floods in the United States occurred more frequently 
from 2006 to 2012 and were associated with more deaths and 
injuries in rural areas compared to urban areas.78 Contributing 
factors include the following: 1) small, rural basins develop 
flash flood conditions much more quickly, providing less time 
to notify rural residents with emergency procedures like 
Coastal floods – predominately caused by storm 
surges that are exacerbated by sea level rise. Coastal 
floods can destroy buildings and infrastructure, 
cause severe coastal erosion, and submerge large 
areas of the coast. 
Flash and urban floods – occur in smaller inland 
natural or urban watersheds and are closely tied to 
heavy rainfall. Flash floods develop within minutes or 
hours after a rainfall event, and can result in severe 
damage and loss of life due to high water velocity, 
heavy debris load, and limited warning.
River floods – occur in large watersheds like the 
Mississippi and Missouri River Basins. River floods 
depend on many factors including precipitation, 
preexisting soil moisture conditions, river basin 
topography, and human factors like land-use change 
and flood control infrastructure (dams, levees).

warnings, road closures, and evacuations; 2) more rural roads 
intersect low-water crossings without bridge infrastructure 
and rural areas have fewer alternative transportation options 
when roads are closed; and 3) rural areas have fewer emer­
gency response units and slower response times.78 Although 
flash floods are less frequent in urban areas, a single urban 
event is likely to result in more deaths and injuries than a rural 
event.78 
Drowning in floodwaters was the leading cause of death 
(estimated 2,544 persons) among people  directly exposed 
to hazards associated with hurricanes and coastal storms 
from 1963 to 2012.79 Hurricanes are typically associated with 
coastal flooding, but they can also cause substantial inland 
flooding before, during, and after landfall, even when far from 
the storm’s center (Figure 3).80, 81, 82 
The deadliest U.S. storms of this century to date were Hur­
ricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. Katrina was a very 
large and powerful Category 3 storm that hit the Gulf Coast 
region in 2005. Hurricane Katrina was responsible for almost 
half of the hurricane-related deaths over the past 50 years,79 
with the majority of deaths directly related to the storm in 
Louisiana (an estimated 971 to 1,300 deaths) due to drown­
ing or flood-related physical trauma due to the failure of the 
levees in New Orleans.83, 84 Sandy was a historically rare storm 
that affected a large portion of the country in October 2012, 
with particularly significant human health and infrastructure 
impacts in New Jersey and the greater New York City area. Su­
perstorm Sandy is estimated to have caused between 117 and 
147 direct deaths across the Atlantic basin, also with drown­
ing and flood-related physical trauma as the leading cause of 
death.85, 86
Both fatal and non-fatal flood-related injuries can occur in any 
phase of the event: before (preparation or evacuation), during, 
and after (cleanup and recovery). Common flood-related inju­
ries include blunt trauma from falling debris or objects moving 
quickly in floodwater, electrocution, falls, and motor vehicle 
accidents from wet, damaged, or obstructed roads.1, 29, 58 Other 
common, generally non-fatal injuries include cuts, puncture 
wounds, sprains/strains, burns, hypothermia, and animal bites.1, 
29, 58 Exposure to floodwaters or to contaminated drinking water 
can cause gastrointestinal illness; wound infections; skin irrita­
tions and infections; and eye, ear, nose, and throat infections.1, 
29 Many of these injuries have been observed in occupational 
settings 31 and in rural areas.78 
In the United States, populations with greater vulnerability to 
flood-related injuries and illnesses include older adults, the 
immunocompromised and others with existing illness (es­
pecially if dependent on routine medical treatments or drug 
prescriptions), certain racial/ethnic groups (Black and Hispanic 
or Latino), people with limited English proficiency, and peo­
ple with lower socioeconomic status (especially if uninsured, 
unemployed, or living in poor-quality housing).1, 73 Differences in 
Figure 3: Composite map of floods associated with landfalling 
hurricanes over the past 31 years, based on stream gauge data. 
The Flood Ratio (Q) refers to maximum hurricane-related flood 
peaks compared to 10-year flood peaks (expected to occur, 
on average, once every 10 years and corresponds to the 90th 
percentile of the flood peak distribution) calculated for the same 
area. See Villarini et al. 2014 for a detailed description of how Q 
values are calculated.80 
Q values between 0.6 and 1 (light blue and yellow) generally 
indicate minor to moderate flooding, while values above 1 
(orange and red) generally indicate major flooding larger than the 
10-year flood peak. The dark gray areas of the map represent 
the extent of the 500-km buffer around the center of circulation 
of the hurricanes included during the study period (the light gray 
areas of the map fall outside of the study area). 
Figure 3 shows that hurricanes are important contributors to 
flooding in the eastern United States, as well as large areas of 
the central United States. Land use/land cover properties and 
soil moisture conditions are also important factors for flooding.

exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity lead to a dispropor­
tionate number of flood-related fatalities among older adults, 
males, and some low-income communities of color.29 For exam­
ple, almost half of deaths from Hurricane Katrina were people 
over age 75, while for Superstorm Sandy almost half were over 
age 65.1, 29 The Black adult mortality rate from Hurricane Katrina 
was 1.7 to 4 times higher than that of whites.29, 84 Floods and 
storms also create numerous occupational health risks, with 
most storm-related fatalities associated with cleanup activities 
(44%), construction (26%), public utilities restoration (8%), and 
security/policing (6%).1 First responders and other emergency 
workers face greater health and safety risks when working in 
conditions with infrastructure disruptions, communication 
interruptions, and social unrest or violence following floods and 
storms.73, 87, 88
Pregnant women and newborns are uniquely vulnerable to 
flood health hazards. Flood exposure was associated with 
adverse birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight) after 
Hurricane Katrina and the 1997 floods in North Dakota.89, 90 
Floods and storms can also create conditions in which chil­
dren can become separated from their parents or caregivers, 
which—particularly for children with disabilities or special 
health care needs—increases their vulnerability to a range of 
health threats, including death, injury, disease, psychological 
trauma, and abuse.91, 92, 93 Flood-related mental health impacts 
are associated with direct and longer-term losses, social im­
pacts, stress, and economic hardship.1, 29, 58 Women, children, 
older adults, low-income populations, and those in poor 
health, with prior mental health issues, or with weak social 
networks may be especially vulnerable to the mental health 
impacts of floods (Ch. 8: Mental Health).
4.5	 Droughts 
Drought may be linked to a broad set of health hazards, 
including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, flash 
flooding, degraded air and water quality, and reduced water 
quantity.74 Exposure risk to potential drought health hazards 
is expected to vary widely across the nation, depending on 
several localized variables, such as characteristics of the built 
environment, loss of livelihoods, local demand for water, and 
changes in ecosystems.94, 95 Researching the health effects of 
drought poses unique challenges given multiple definitions 
of the beginning and end of a drought, and because health 
effects tend to accumulate over time. In addition, health im­
pacts do not occur in isolation. For example, droughts intensify 
heat waves by reducing evaporative cooling,2 further compli­
cating efforts to attribute specific health outcomes to specific 
drought conditions.
A primary health implication of drought arises from the 
contamination and depletion of water sources,95 but there 
are few studies documenting specific health consequences 
in the United States.96 Drought in coastal areas can increase 
saltwater intrusion (the movement of ocean water into fresh 
groundwater), reducing the supply and quality of potable wa­
ter.97, 98, 99 In addition to reducing water quantity, drought can 
decrease water quality when low flow or stagnant conditions 
increase concentrations of pollutants or contaminants (such as 
chemicals and heavy metals) and when higher temperatures 
encourage pathogen growth.95, 96, 100, 101, 102, 103 Heavy rain follow­
ing drought can flush accumulated pathogens or contaminants 
into water bodies.104, 105 Reduced surface and groundwater 
quality can increase risk of water-related illness as well as 
foodborne illness if pathogens or contaminants enter the food 
chain (see Ch. 6: Water-Related Illness and Ch. 7: Food Safety).
In some regions of the United States, drought has been associ­
ated with increased incidence of West Nile virus disease.106, 107, 
108, 109, 110 Human exposure risk to West Nile virus may increase 
during drought conditions due to a higher prevalence of the 
virus in mosquito and bird populations as a result of closer 
contact between birds (virus hosts) and mosquitoes (vectors) 
as they congregate around remaining water sources (see Ch. 
5: Vector-Borne Diseases) .111 Primarily in the Southwest, 
droughts followed by periods of heavy rainfall have been 
associated with an increase in rodent populations.112, 113, 114 
This could lead to increased exposures to rodent allergens and 
rodent-borne diseases, such as hantavirus.115, 116, 117

implications of drought include contamination and depletion of

Fungi growth and dispersal are sensitive to changes in temperature, moisture, and wind.136 Illnesses or allergic 
reactions related to fungal toxins and superficial or invasive fungal infections can cause serious illness, permanent 
disability, or death. People generally become infected by breathing in fungal spores directly from the environment 
or having spores enter the skin at sites of injury. Coccidioidomycosis, also called “Valley Fever,” is an infection 
caused by Coccidioides, a fungus found mainly in the southwestern United States. Reports of these infections 
are on the rise.137 The fungus appears to grow best in soil after heavy rainfall and then becomes airborne most 
effectively during hot, dry conditions.138 Several studies in Arizona and California, where most reported cases in 
the United States occur, suggest that climate likely plays a role in seasonal and yearly infection patterns.139, 140 
Recently, Coccidioides was found in soil in south-central Washington, far north of where it was previously known 
to exist.141 Climate factors such as drought and increased temperature may be contributing to Coccidioides’ 
expanded geographic range.142 Thus, more prolonged or intense droughts resulting from climate change could lead 
to improved conditions for the spread of Coccidioides.143 Understanding the impact of climate change on fungal 
infections (such as Coccidioidomycosis, Crypotcoccos gattii, and Mucormycosis) would require comprehensive 
epidemiologic surveillance, better methods to detect disease-causing fungi in the environment, and ongoing 
multidisciplinary collaboration. 
Fungal Diseases and Climate Change 
FPO
Drought may increase the potential for 
wind erosion to cause soil dust to become 
airborne, and there is evidence from past 
trends showing regional increases in dust 
activity due to drought cycles, but there is 
large uncertainty about future projections 
of climate impacts on frequency or 
intensity of dust storms.119, 128, 129 Wind 
erosion can also be exacerbated by 
human activities that disturb the soil, 
including growing crops, livestock grazing, 
recreation and suburbanization, and 
water diversion for irrigation.119, 128, 130 
Major dust activity in the United States is 
centered in the Southwest, where sources 
are mostly natural, and the Great Plains, 
extending from Montana to southern Texas, where sources are mainly from human activities associated with land 
use, such as agriculture.131 These are also regions where climate change is expected to affect drought patterns.2 
In the United States, dust exposure has been linked to increased incidence in respiratory disease, including 
asthma, acute bronchitis, and pneumonia.27, 132, 133 However, the dust characteristics (such as composition and 
particle size), exposure levels, and biological mechanisms responsible for the observed health effects of dust are not 
completely understood. In part, this is because observations are generally unavailable in areas where dust exposure 
is greatest, including drylands and agricultural areas.122 Apart from illness, intense dust storms are also associated 
with impaired visibility, which can cause road traffic accidents resulting in injury and death.134, 135

Drought conditions also tend to reduce air quality and exacer­
bate respiratory illness by way of several mechanisms associ­
ated with soil drying, loss of vegetation, airborne particulate 
matter, and the creation of conditions conducive for dust 
storms and wildfires.118, 119 In addition, air pollutants such as 
soluble trace gases and particles remain suspended in the air 
when there is a lack of precipitation (see Ch. 3: Air Quality 
Impacts).120 Inhalation of particles can irritate bronchial pas­
sages and lungs, resulting in exacerbated chronic respiratory 
illnesses.95 The size of particles is directly linked to their poten­
tial health effects. Exposure to fine particles is associated with 
cardiovascular illness (for example, heart attacks and strokes) 
and premature death, and is likely associated with adverse 
respiratory effects.121 There is greater uncertainty regarding 
the health effects of inhaling coarse particles (often found in 
soil dust), but some evidence indicates an association with 
premature death and cardiovascular and respiratory effects.121, 
122, 123
Mental health issues have also been observed during drought 
periods through research primarily conducted in Australia 
(see also Ch. 8: Mental Health).94 Rural areas, in particular, can 
experience a rise in mental health issues related to economic 
insecurity from drought.94, 124, 125, 126, 127
4.6	 Wildfires
Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and 
intensity of large wildfires (Figure 4), with associated health 
risks projected to increase in many regions.74, 144 Wildfire can 
have health impacts well beyond the perimeter of the fire. 
Populations near the fire or even thousands of miles down­
wind may be exposed to a complex smoke mixture containing 
various substances including carbon monoxide, ozone, toxic 
chemicals, and both fine and coarse particles,145, 146 presenting 
a serious health risk for the exposed populations (see Ch. 3: 
Air Quality Impacts).147, 148 For example, the 2002 forest fires 
in Quebec resulted in up to a 30-fold increase in airborne fine 
particulate concentrations in Baltimore, Maryland, a city near­
ly 1,000 miles downwind.74 Exposure times can range from a 
few days to several weeks.145, 149, 150 
Exposure to smoke-related air pollutants from wildfires has 
been associated with a wide range of human health effects, 
including early deaths and low infant birth weight, with the 
strongest evidence for acute respiratory illness.145, 146, 151, 152, 153, 
154, 155 Inhalation of smoke from wildfire has been linked to ex­
acerbated respiratory problems, such as shortness of breath, 
asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).154, 
156, 157, 158 While the association between smoke exposure and 
cardiovascular outcomes is uncertain,154 exposure to fine par­
ticles contributes to risk of cardiovascular disease and prema­
ture death.159, 160, 161, 162 
Wildfires can also affect indoor air quality for those living near 
affected areas by increasing particulate matter concentrations 
within homes, leading to many of the adverse health impacts 
already discussed.149, 163 For example, during the 2007 San 
Diego wildfires, health monitoring showed excess emergency 
room visits for asthma, respiratory problems, chest pain, and 
COPD. During times of peak fire particulate matter concentra­
tions, the odds of a person seeking emergency care increased 
by 50% when compared to non-fire conditions.164 Smoke from 
wildfires can also impair driving visibility, increasing risks of 
motor vehicle deaths and injuries.134, 165, 166, 167 
Exposure to smoke-related air pollutants from wildfires has 
been associated with a wide range of human health effects.
Figure 4: Based on 17 climate model simulations for the 
continental United States using a higher emissions pathway 
(RCP8.5), the map shows projected percentage increases in 
weeks with risk of very large fires by mid-century (2041–2070) 
compared to the recent past (1971–2000). The darkest shades 
of red indicated that up to a 6-fold increase in risk is projected for 
parts of the West. This area includes the Great Basin, Northern 
Rockies, and parts of Northern California. Gray represents areas 
within the continental United States where there is either no data 
or insufficient historical observations on very large fires to build 
robust models. The potential for very large fire events is also 
expected to increase along the southern coastline and in areas 
around the Great Lakes. (Figure source: adapted from Barbero

Pregnant women, children, and the elderly are more sensitive 
to the harmful health effects of wildfire smoke exposure (see 
also Ch. 9: Populations of Concern).12, 156, 168, 169 Firefighters are 
exposed to significantly higher levels and longer periods of 
exposure to combustion products from fires, leading to health 
risks that include decreased lung function, inflammation, and 
respiratory system problems, as well as injuries from burns 
and falling trees.145, 168, 170, 171, 172, 173
Wildfires can also create an increased burden on the health 
care system and public health infrastructure. For example, 
wildfires near populated areas often necessitate large evacu­
ations, requiring extensive public health resources, including 
shelter, and treatment of individuals for injuries, smoke inha­
lation, and mental health impacts.67, 166, 174, 175 Housing devel­
opment in or near the wildland–urban interface has expanded 
over the last several decades and is expected to continue to 
expand.176 These changing development patterns in combina­
tion with a changing climate are increasing the vulnerability of 
these areas to wildfires.177, 178, 179 
Following wildfire, increased soil erosion rates and changes 
to runoff generation may contaminate water-supply reser­
voirs and disrupt downstream drinking water supplies.180, 181 
Post-wildfire erosion and runoff has been linked to increased 
flooding and debris flow hazards, depending on the severity 
of the fire, seasonal rainfall patterns, watershed characteris­
tics, and the size of the burn area.182, 183, 184, 185 Wildfires have a 
range of short- and long-term effects on watersheds that have 
the potential to change water quality, quantity, availability, 
and treatability downstream from the burned area.186, 187, 188
4.7	 Winter Storms and Severe Thunderstorms
The primary health hazards of severe thunderstorms are from 
lightning and high winds, while the principal winter storm haz­
ards include extreme cold temperatures (see Ch. 2: Tempera­
ture-related Deaths and Illness), frozen precipitation, and as­
sociated dangerous road and other conditions. Future health 
impacts associated with these types of storms are uncertain 
and will depend on how climate change affects storm trends. 
During the period 1956 to 2006, lightning caused an estimated 
101.2 deaths per year,189 while thunderstorm winds are esti­
mated to have caused approximately 26 deaths per year from 
1977 to 2007.190 Thunderstorm precipitation and winds can 
damage structures, fell trees, and create hazardous road con­
ditions and impair driving visibility, increasing risks of motor 
vehicle deaths and injuries.134, 191, 192 Thunderstorm winds can 
cause blunt trauma or injuries, such as from being struck by 
falling trees and other flying debris,46 and were responsible for 
an estimated 4,366 injuries during the period 1993 to 2003.192
Winter storms can be accompanied by freezing winds and frig­
id temperatures that can cause frostbite and hypothermia (see 
also Ch. 2: Temperature-Related Deaths and Illness).193, 194 Indi­
viduals that lack proper clothing and shelter (for example, the 
homeless) are more at risk of injuries from direct exposure to 
weather conditions associated with winter storms and severe 
thunderstorms.195 Low-income populations have increased ex­
posure risk to severe winter weather conditions because they 
are more likely to live in low-quality, poorly insulated housing; 
be unable to afford sufficient domestic heating; or need to 
make tradeoffs between food and heating expenditures.196, 197 
Freezing rain, snow, and ice have been linked to increased in­
juries associated with falling198 as well as motor vehicle deaths 
and injuries due to treacherous road conditions and impaired 
driving visibility.134, 199 
After severe thunderstorms, individuals can suffer injuries 
during debris removal and cleanup activities192, 200 as well as 
exposure to hazards if flooding occurs (see Section 4.4 of this 
chapter). Mental health issues and stress are also possible 
after storms (see Ch. 8: Mental Health). This is especially true 
of thunderstorms associated with tornadoes, as the aftermath 
of the storm can involve dealing with the loss of property, dis­
placement, or loss of life.201 After winter storms, snow removal 
can be strenuous work and can increase the likelihood of ill­
ness and death for individuals with preexisting cardiovascular 
or pulmonary conditions.202 
4.8	 Emerging Issues
Climate change and changing patterns of extreme weather 
have the potential to strain the capacity of public health sys­
tems. However, few comprehensive or systematic studies have 
examined the human health impacts of such health-system 
strain.203 Particularly in the context of floods and hurricanes, 
the impacts on health systems from short- and long-term pop­
ulation displacement are not fully understood or well quan­
tified.67 In addition, the role of future population migration 
and demographic changes is just beginning to be elucidated 
in assessments of local adaptive capacity or resilience to the 
effects of future extreme events. Methodological challenges 
remain for accurately quantifying and attributing delayed 
Freezing rain, snow, and ice have been linked to increased 
injuries associated with treacherous road conditions and 
impaired driving visibility.

mortality associated with, but not caused directly by, extreme 
event exposure—for example, elevated mortality associated 
with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and infections and other 
complications from injuries in populations exposed to hurri­
canes.30, 31
4.9	 Research Needs 
In addition the emerging issues identified above, the authors 
highlight the following potential areas for additional scientific 
and research activity on extreme events based on their review 
of the literature. Current understanding is limited by a lack 
of systematic surveillance for the range of health impacts, 
both short and long term, associated with a wider range of 
extreme events, including prolonged events like droughts and 
other extremes that do not currently trigger post-event health 
surveillance.  
Future assessments can benefit from multidisciplinary re­
search activities that:
•	 better define the health implications associated with partic­
ular extreme events where longer-term impacts, as well as 
regional differences in health outcomes, are currently not 
well understood, such as droughts and floods;
•	 enhance understanding of how specific attributes that 
contribute to individual and community level vulnerability to 
health impacts after extreme events, including social and be­
havioral characteristics, interact and contribute to or mitigate 
risks of adverse health outcomes; and
•	 examine how health outcomes can be impacted by other 
cumulative, compounding, or secondary effects of extreme 
events, such as access to or disruption of healthcare services 
and damages to and cascading failures of infrastructure.

Supporting Evidence
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING CHAPTER
The chapter was developed through technical discussions 
of relevant evidence and expert deliberation by the report 
authors at several workshops, teleconferences, and email 
exchanges. Authors considered inputs and comments 
submitted by the public, the National Academies of Sciences, 
and Federal agencies. For additional information on the 
overall report process, please see Appendices 2 and 3.
The health outcomes selected and prioritized for the chapter 
were based primarily on those that had substantial peer-
reviewed literature to support statements. While many 
connections between changes in extreme events due to 
climate change and human health impacts appear intuitive, in 
some cases there may not be a robust body of peer-reviewed 
literature to support statements about direct effects. For 
example, while it is believed that droughts have the ability to 
impact water quality, which could in turn impact health, there 
are few studies documenting specific health consequences in 
the United States.96 
In addition, due to space constraints, the authors did not 
intend to exhaustively identify all possible health impacts 
from every type of extreme event addressed in this chapter. 
Instead, the authors have provided an overview of possible 
impacts from different types of extreme events and provided 
a framework for understanding what additional factors 
(for example, population vulnerability, existing quality of 
infrastructure, etc.) can exacerbate or reduce adverse health 
outcomes.
Due to limited space and the uncertainty around future 
projections of tornadoes, we do not include detailed 
discussion of this topic in this chapter. We recognize that 
tornadoes can cause significant infrastructure damage 
and significant health impacts, and understanding how 
climate change will impact tornado intensity, frequency, 
and geographic distribution is an area of active scientific 
investigation. 
KEY FINDING TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS
Increased Exposure to Extreme Events
Key Finding 1: Health impacts associated with climate-related 
changes in exposure to extreme events include death, injury, 
or illness; exacerbation of underlying medical conditions; and 
adverse effects on mental health [High Confidence]. Climate 
change will increase exposure risk in some regions of the 
United States due to projected increases in the frequency 
and/or intensity of drought, wildfires, and flooding related to 
extreme precipitation and hurricanes [Medium Confidence].
Description of evidence base
The Third National Climate Assessment (2014 NCA) provides 
the most recent, peer-reviewed assessment conclusions 
for projected increases in the frequency and/or intensity 
of extreme precipitation, hurricanes, coastal inundation, 
drought, and wildfires in the United States.2 To the extent 
that these extreme events are projected to increase in some 
regions of the United States, people are expected to be at 
greater risk of exposure to health hazards. 
Flooding associated with extreme precipitation, hurricanes, 
and coastal storms is expected to increase in some regions of 
the United States due to climate change, thereby increasing 
exposure to a variety of health hazards.9, 73, 74 The health 
impacts of floods and storms include death, injury, and illness; 
exacerbation of underlying medical conditions; and adverse 
effects on mental health.1, 29, 31, 46, 51, 52, 53, 58
Climate change is projected to lengthen or intensify droughts, 
especially in the Southwest,2, 144 which may increase exposure 
to a broad set of health hazards.9, 74 The potential health 
impacts of drought include: illness associated with reduced 
water quality and quantity 96, 100, 101, 102, 103 and reduced air 
quality,95, 118, 119 associations with increased rates of some 
infectious diseases,106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and adverse mental health 
impacts.94, 124, 125, 126, 127
Large, intense wildfires will occur more frequently in some 
regions of the United States, particularly in the western 
United States and Alaska,2 and this is expected to increase 
exposure to wildfire-related health risks.74, 144 The health 
impacts of wildfire include death, injury, and illness,134, 145, 146, 
151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 165, 166, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173 including exacerbation of 
underlying medical conditions.154, 156, 157
Major uncertainties 
The role of climate change in observed shifts in and 
future projections of the frequency, intensity, geographic 
distribution, and duration of certain extreme events is an 
ongoing, active area of research. For example, although the 
2014 NCA2 concluded that extreme events will increase in 
some regions of the United States, uncertainties remain 
with respect to projections of climate impacts at smaller, 
more local scales and the timing of such impacts (see Table 
1). Climate change related projections of winter storms and 
severe storms, including tornadoes, hail, and thunderstorms, 
are still uncertain. 

4–IMPACTS OF EXTREME EVENTS ON HUMAN HEALTH

114
The human health implications of the changes in extreme 
events have not received as much research attention to 
date, and there are currently no published, national-scale, 
quantitative projections of changes in exposure risks for 
the four categories of extreme events addressed in this 
chapter. Relevant health surveillance and epidemiological 
data for extreme events are limited by underreporting, 
underestimation, and lack of a common definition of what 
constitutes an adverse health impact from an extreme 
event.30, 31 For drought in particular, there are few studies 
documenting specific health consequences in the United 
States.96 Challenges to quantitatively estimating future 
human health risks for the four types of extreme events 
addressed in this chapter include limited data availability 
and lack of comprehensive modeling methods. For winter 
storms and severe storms especially, scientists need a better 
understanding of how climate change will affect future storm 
trends before they can make projections of future health 
impacts.
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
There is high confidence that the types of health impacts 
associated with climate-related changes in extremes include 
death, injury, or illness; exacerbation of underlying medical 
conditions; and adverse effects on mental health (see Table 
1). Based on the evidence presented in the peer-reviewed 
literature, there is medium confidence regarding increases 
in exposure to health hazards associated with projected 
increases in the frequency and/or intensity of extreme 
precipitation, hurricanes, coastal inundation, drought, 
and wildfires in some regions of the United States. Many 
qualitative studies have been published about the potential 
or expected health hazards from these events, but few draw 
strong or definitive conclusions that exposure to health 
hazards will increase due to climate change. Thus, the 
evidence is suggestive and supports a medium confidence 
level that, to the extent that these extreme events are 
projected to increase in some regions of the United States, 
people are expected to be at greater risk of exposure to 
health hazards. There is no quantitative information on which 
to base probability estimates of the likelihood of increasing 
exposure to health hazards associated with extreme 
precipitation, hurricanes, coastal inundation, drought, and 
wildfires.
Disruption of Essential Infrastructure
Key Finding 2: Many types of extreme events related to 
climate change cause disruption of infrastructure, including 
power, water, transportation, and communication systems, 
that are essential to maintaining access to health care and 
emergency response services and safeguarding human health 
[High Confidence].
Description of evidence base
The frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events 
determines their physical impacts and the extent to which 
essential infrastructure is disrupted. There is strong, 
consistent evidence from multiple studies that infrastructure 
can either exacerbate or moderate the physical impacts of 
extreme events, influencing the ultimate nature and severity 
of health impacts. Projections of increasing frequency and/
or intensity of some extreme events suggest that they 
pose threats to essential infrastructure, such as water, 
transportation, and power systems.4, 34, 36, 43 Disruption of 
essential infrastructure and services after extreme events 
can increase population exposure to health hazards and 
reduce their adaptive capacity.4 There is substantial, high-
quality literature supporting a finding that serious health risks 
can arise from utility outages; infrastructure and housing 
damage; and disruption or loss of access to sanitation, 
safe food and water supplies, health care, communication, 
and transportation.1, 29, 30, 31, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 58, 87 
Infrastructure disruptions can have more or less impact on 
human health depending on the underlying vulnerability of 
the affected people and communities.4 Urban populations 
face unique exposure risks due to their dependence on 
complex, often interdependent infrastructure systems that 
can be severely disrupted during extreme events.2, 65 Rural 
communities also have vulnerabilities that are different from 
those faced by urban communities. For example, power and 
communications can take longer to restore after an outage.50
Existing infrastructure is generally designed to perform at its 
engineered capacity assuming historical weather patterns, 
and these systems could be more vulnerable to failure in 
response to weather-related stressors under future climate 
scenarios.4, 34, 35 Shifts in the frequency or intensity of extreme 
events outside their historical range pose infrastructure 
risks that may be compounded by the fact that much of the 
existing critical infrastructure in the United States, including 
water and sewage systems, roads, bridges, and power plants, 
are aging and in need of repair or replacement.4, 36
Major uncertainties
Many of the uncertainties are similar to those of the 
previous key finding. There are few studies directly linking 
infrastructure impacts to health outcomes, and most are not 
longitudinal. Health impacts may occur after the event as 
a result of loss of infrastructure and public services. These 
impacts can be distributed over longer periods of time, 
making them harder to observe and quantify. Thus, the actual 
impact is likely underreported.  
Uncertainties remain with respect to projecting how climate 
change will affect the severity of the physical impacts, 
including on infrastructure, of extreme events at smaller, 
more local scales and the timing of such impacts. Therefore, 
the subsequent impact on infrastructure also has a great

115
There is strong, consistent evidence in the literature that 
coastal flooding will increase exposure to a variety of health 
hazards—for example, direct physical impacts and impacts 
associated with disruption of essential infrastructure—
which can result in death, injury, or illness; exacerbation of 
underlying medical conditions; and adverse effects on mental 
health.1, 29, 31, 46, 51, 52, 53, 58 Multiple studies also consistently 
identify certain populations as especially vulnerable to 
the health impacts of coastal flooding. These populations 
include older adults (especially those who are frail, medically 
incapacitated, or residing in nursing or assisted living 
facilities), children, those reliant on electrically powered 
medical equipment like ventilators and oxygen supplies, 
those with preexisting health conditions, and people with 
disabilities.1, 8, 22, 43, 44, 53, 54, 195, 196, 197 In addition, differences 
in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity lead to a 
disproportionate number of flood-related fatalities among 
older adults, males, and some low-income communities of 
color.29 Floods and storms also create occupational health 
risks to first responders and other emergency workers and 
to people involved in cleanup activities, construction, public 
utilities restoration, and security/policing.1, 73, 87, 88,
Major uncertainties
It is nearly certain that coastal flooding will increase in the 
United States. There are varying estimates regarding the 
exact degree of flooding at any particular location along the 
coast. Modeling does provide estimated ranges with varying 
levels of confidence depending on the location. There is 
greater uncertainty about how coastal flooding will impact 
the health of specific populations. There are various ways 
in which these key risk factors interact with and contribute 
to the vulnerability (comprised of exposure, sensitivity, and 
adaptive capacity) of a population. Some uncertainties exist 
regarding the relative importance of each of these factors in 
determining a population’s vulnerability to health impacts 
from extreme events. In addition, there is some uncertainty 
regarding how future demographic and population changes 
may affect the relative importance of each of these factors.
Assessment of confidence based on evidence
Based on the evidence presented in the peer-reviewed 
literature, there is high confidence that coastal flooding will 
increase in the United States, and that age, health status, 
socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and occupation are 
key risk factors that individually and collectively affect a 
population’s vulnerability to health impacts from coastal 
flooding. Many qualitative studies have been published 
regarding how these key risk factors interact with and 
contribute to the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity 
of a population, and this evidence is of good quality and 
consistent.
deal of uncertainty. Thus, the key finding does not make 
any statements about future impacts.  Instead the focus 
is on impacts that have occurred to date because there is 
supporting peer-reviewed literature. The extent to which 
infrastructure is exposed to extreme events, and the adaptive 
capacity of a community to repair infrastructure in a timely 
manner both influence the extent of the health outcomes. 
Thus, while the chapter makes general statements about 
trends in impacts due to extremes, there are uncertainties 
in the extent to which any specific location or infrastructure 
system could be impacted and the resulting health outcomes. 
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
There is high confidence that many types of extreme events 
can cause disruption of essential infrastructure (such as water, 
transportation, and power systems), and that such disruption 
can adversely affect human health. Many qualitative studies 
have been published about the effects of these factors on 
health impacts from an extreme event (noted above), and the 
evidence is of good quality and consistent.
Vulnerability to Coastal Flooding
Key Finding 3: Coastal populations with greater vulnerability 
to health impacts from coastal flooding include persons with 
disabilities or other access and functional needs, certain 
populations of color, older adults, pregnant women and 
children, low-income populations, and some occupational 
groups [High Confidence]. Climate change will increase 
exposure risk to coastal flooding due to increases in extreme 
precipitation and in hurricane intensity and rainfall rates, 
as well as sea level rise and the resulting increases in storm 
surge [High Confidence].
Description of evidence base
The evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that climate 
change will increase coastal flooding in the future is very 
robust.2, 4 Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since 
reliable record keeping began in 1880 and it is projected to 
rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100.2 Rates of sea level rise are 
not uniform along U.S. coasts and can be exacerbated locally 
by land subsidence or reduced by uplift. In the next several 
decades, storm surges and high tides could combine with 
sea level rise and land subsidence to further increase coastal 
flooding in many regions. The U.S. East and Gulf coasts, Hawaii, 
and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands are particularly at risk. 
In addition, recurrent weather-related stressors, such as 
“nuisance flooding” (frequent coastal flooding causing 
public inconveniences), contribute to overall deterioration 
of infrastructure like stormwater drainage systems and 
roads (see Ch. 6: Water-Related Illness).38 These systems are 
important in the context of health because drainage helps 
to avoid sewage overflows and maintain water quality,39 
and roads are vital for evacuations and emergency response 
during and after extreme events.40

Key Findings
Increased Risk of Foodborne Illness
Key Finding 1: Climate change, including rising temperatures and changes in weather extremes, is expected 
to increase the exposure of food to certain pathogens and toxins [Likely, High Confidence]. This will increase 
the risk of negative health impacts [Likely, Medium Confidence], but actual incidence of foodborne illness 
will depend on the efficacy of practices that safeguard food in the United States [High Confidence]. 
Chemical Contaminants in the Food Chain
Key Finding 2: Climate change will increase human exposure to chemical contaminants in food through 
several pathways [Likely, Medium Confidence]. Elevated sea surface temperatures will lead to greater 
accumulation of mercury in seafood [Likely, Medium Confidence], while increases in extreme weather 
events will introduce contaminants into the food chain [Likely, Medium Confidence]. Rising carbon dioxide 
concentrations and climate change will alter incidence and distribution of pests, parasites, and microbes 
[Very Likely, High Confidence], leading to increases in the use of pesticides and veterinary drugs [Likely, 
Medium Confidence].
Rising Carbon Dioxide Lowers Nutritional Value of Food
Key Finding 3: The nutritional value of agriculturally important food crops, such as wheat and rice, will 
decrease as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to reduce the concentrations of protein and 
essential minerals in most plant species [Very Likely, High Confidence].
Extreme Weather Limits Access to Safe Foods
Key Finding 4: Increases in the frequency or intensity of some extreme weather events associated with 
climate change will increase disruptions of food distribution by damaging existing infrastructure or slowing 
food shipments [Likely, High Confidence]. These impediments lead to increased risk for food damage, 
spoilage, or contamination, which will limit availability of and access to safe and nutritious food depending 
on the extent of disruption and the resilience of food distribution infrastructure [Medium Confidence].

7.1	 Introduction 
A safe and nutritious food supply is a vital component of food 
security. Food security, in a public health context, can be sum­
marized as permanent access to a sufficient, safe, and nutri­
tious food supply needed to maintain an active and healthy 
lifestyle.1 
The impacts of climate change on food production, prices, and 
trade for the United States and globally have been widely ex­
amined, including in the U.S. Global Change Research Program 
(USGCRP) report, “Climate Change, Global Food Security, and 
the U.S. Food System,” in the most recent Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change report, and elsewhere.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 An 
overall finding of the USGCRP report was that “climate change 
is very likely to affect global, regional, and local food security 
by disrupting food availability, decreasing access to food, and 
making utilization more difficult.”1 
Farm to Table
The Potential Interactions of Rising CO2 and Climate Change on Food Safety and Nutrition
Figure 1: The food system involves a network of interactions with our physical and biological environments as 
food moves from production to consumption, or from “farm to table.” Rising CO2 and climate change will affect 
the quality and distribution of food, with subsequent effects on food safety and nutrition. 
This chapter focuses on some of the less reported aspects of 
food security, specifically, the impacts of climate change on 
food safety, nutrition, and distribution in the context of human 
health in the United States. While ingestion of contaminated 
seafood is discussed in this chapter, details on the exposure 
pathways of water related pathogens (for example, through 
recreational or drinking water) are discussed in Chapter 6: 
Water-Related Illness.
Systems and processes related to food safety, nutrition, and 
production are inextricably linked to their physical and biologi­
cal environment.5, 8 Although production is important, for most 
developed countries such as the United States, food shortages 
are uncommon; rather, nutritional quality and food safety are 
the primary health concerns.5, 9 Certain populations, such as 
the poor, children, and Indigenous populations, may be more 
vulnerable to climate impacts on food safety, nutrition, and 
distribution (see also Ch. 9: Populations of Concern).

192
There are two overarching means by which increasing carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and climate change alter safety, nutrition, and 
distribution of food. The first is associated with rising global 
temperatures and the subsequent changes in weather patterns 
and extreme climate events.13, 14, 15 Current and anticipated 
changes in climate and the physical environment have con­
sequences for contamination, spoilage, and the disruption of 
food distribution. 
The second pathway is through the direct CO2 “fertilization” 
effect on plant photosynthesis. Higher concentrations of CO2 
stimulate growth and carbohydrate production in some plants, 
but can lower the levels of protein and essential minerals in a 
number of widely consumed crops, including wheat, rice, and 
potatoes, with potentially negative implications for human 
nutrition.16 
Figure 2: This conceptual diagram for a Salmonella example illustrates the key pathways by which humans are exposed to health 
threats from climate drivers, and potential resulting health outcomes (center boxes). These exposure pathways exist within the context 
of other factors that positively or negatively influence health outcomes (gray side boxes). Key factors that influence vulnerability for 
individuals are shown in the right box, and include social determinants of health and behavioral choices. Key factors that influence 
vulnerability at larger scales, such as natural and built environments, governance and management, and institutions, are shown in 
the left box. All of these influencing factors can affect an individual’s or a community’s vulnerability through changes in exposure, 
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity and may also be affected by climate change. See Ch. 1: Introduction for more information.
Climate Change and Health—Salmonella
Food Safety – Those conditions and measures 
necessary for food production, processing, 
storage, and distribution in order to ensure a safe, 
sound, wholesome product that is fit for human 
consumption.10
Foodborne Illness or Disease – Foodborne illness 
(sometimes called “food poisoning”) is a common 
public health problem. Each year, one in six 
Americans reports getting sick by consuming 
contaminated foods or beverages.11 Foodborne 
disease is caused by ingestion of contaminated 
food. Many different disease-causing microbes, or 
pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are 
many different foodborne infections. In addition, 
food contaminated by toxins or chemicals can also 
result in foodborne illness.12

7.2	 Food Safety
Although the United States has one of the safest food supplies 
in the world,17 food safety remains an important public health 
issue. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are 48 million cases 
of foodborne illnesses per year, with approximately 3,000 
deaths.12 As climate change drives changes in environmental 
variables such as ambient temperature, precipitation, and 
weather extremes (particularly flooding and drought), increas­
es in foodborne illnesses are expected.18, 19
Most acute illnesses are caused by foodborne viruses (specif­
ically noroviruses), followed by bacterial pathogens (such as 
Salmonella; see Table 1). Of the common foodborne illnesses 
in the United States, most deaths are caused by Salmonella, 
followed by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.20, 21, 22, 23 In addition, 
climate change impacts on the transport of chemical contam­
inants or accumulation of pesticides or heavy metals (such as 
mercury) in food, can also represent significant health threats 
in the food chain.22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28
How Climate Affects Food Safety
Climate already influences food safety within an agricultural 
system—prior to, during, and after the harvest, and during 
transport, storage, preparation, and consumption. Changes 
in climate factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and ex­
treme weather are key drivers of pathogen introduction, food 
contamination, and foodborne disease, as well as changes in 
the level of exposure to specific contaminants and chemical 
residues for crops and livestock.29, 30, 31 
The impact of climate on food safety occurs through multiple 
pathways. Changes in air and water temperatures, weath­
er-related changes, and extreme events can shift the sea­
sonal and geographic occurrence of bacteria, viruses, pests, 
parasites, fungi, and other chemical contaminants.23, 30, 31, 32, 33 
For example:
•	 Higher temperatures can increase the number of pathogens 
already present on produce34 and seafood.35, 36 
Figure 3: A review of the published literature from 1960 to 2010 indicates a summertime peak in the incidence of illnesses associated 
with infection from a) Campylobacter, b) Salmonella, and c) Escherichia coli (E. coli). For these three pathogens, the monthly 
seasonality index shown here on the y-axis indicates the global disease incidence above or below the yearly average, which is 
denoted as 100. For example, a value of 145 for the month of July for Salmonellosis would mean that the proportion of cases for 
that month was 45% higher than the 12 month average. Unlike these three pathogens, incidence of norovirus, which can be attained 
through food, has a wintertime peak. The y-axis of the norovirus incidence graph (d) uses a different metric than (a–c): the monthly 
proportion of the annual sum of norovirus cases in the northern hemisphere between 1997 and 2011. For example, a value of 0.12 
for March would indicate that 12% of the annual cases occurred during that month). Solid line represents the average; confidence 
intervals (dashed lines) are plus and minus one standard deviation. (Figure sources: a, b, and c: adapted from Lal et al. 2012; d:

which, depending on time and temperature, can also in­

Extreme Events).44

Climate Impacts on Pathogen Prevalence
While climate change affects the prevalence of pathogens 
harmful to human health, the extent of exposure and result­
ing illness will depend on individual and institutional sensitiv­
ity and adaptive capacity, including human behavior and the 
effectiveness of food safety regulatory, surveillance, monitor­
ing, and communication systems.
Rising Temperature and Humidity
Climate change will influence the fate, transport, transmission, 
viability, and multiplication rate of pathogens in the food chain. 
For example, increases in average global temperatures and 
humidity will lead to changes in the geographic range, seasonal 
occurrence, and survivability of certain pathogens.9, 48, 49, 50
Ongoing changes in temperature 
and humidity will not affect all 
foodborne pathogens equal­
ly (Table 1). The occurrence 
of some pathogens, such as 
Salmonella, Escherichia coli (E. 
coli), and Campylobacter, could 
increase with climate change be­
cause these pathogens thrive in warm, humid conditions. For 
example, Salmonella on raw chicken will double in number 
approximately every hour at 70°F, every 30 minutes at 80°F, 
and every 22 minutes at 90°F.51, 52 
There is a summertime peak in the incidence of illnesses 
associated with these specific pathogens (see Figure 3).18, 48, 53, 
54 This peak may be related not only to warmer temperatures 
favoring pathogen growth but also to an increase in outdoor 
activities, such as barbecues and picnics. Risk for foodborne 
illness is higher when food is prepared outdoors where the 
safety controls that a kitchen provides—thermostat-con­
trolled cooking, refrigeration, and washing facilities—are 
usually not available.5, 18, 19, 48, 55, 56 
Norovirus, the most common cause of stomach flu, can be 
transmitted by consumption of contaminated food. Although 
norovirus generally has a winter seasonal peak (see Figure 
3), changing climate parameters, particularly temperature 
and rainfall, may influence its incidence and spread. Overall, 
localized climate impacts could improve health outcomes 
(fewer cases during warmer winters) or worsen them (elevat­
ed transmission during floods), such that projected trends in 
overall health outcomes for norovirus remain unclear.48, 57
Rising ocean temperatures can increase the risk of pathogen 
exposure from ingestion of contaminated seafood. For exam­
ple, significantly warmer coastal waters in Alaska from 1997 
to 2004 were associated with an outbreak in 2004 of Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus, a bacterium that causes gastrointestinal 
illnesses when contaminated seafood is ingested.58 Vibrio par­
ahaemolyticus is one of the leading causes of seafood-related 
gastroenteritis in the United States and is associated with the 
consumption of raw oysters harvested from warm-water estu­
aries.59 Similarly, the emergence of a related bacterium, Vibrio 
vulnificus, may also be associated with high water tempera­
tures.40 While increasing average water temperatures were 
implicated in a 2004 outbreak,58 ambient air temperature also 
affects pathogen levels of multiple species of Vibrio in shell­
fish.35, 36 For example, Vibrio vulnificus may increase 10- to 
100-fold when oysters are stored at ambient temperatures for 
ten hours before refrigeration.60 Increases in ambient ocean 
water and air temperatures would accelerate Vibrio growth 
in shellfish, potentially necessitating changes in post-harvest 
controls to minimize the increased risk of exposure. (For more 
information on Vibrio and other 
water-related pathogens, includ­
ing contamination of recreation­
al and drinking water, see Ch. 6: 
Water-Related Illness). 
Finally, climate change is 
projected to result in warmer 
winters, earlier springs, and an 
increase in the overall growing season in many regions.61, 62 
While there are potential food production benefits from such 
changes, warmer and longer growing seasons could also alter 
the timing and occurrence of pathogen transmissions in food 
and the chance of human exposure.63, 64, 65 
Extreme Events
In addition to the effects of increasing average temperature 
and humidity on pathogen survival and growth, increases in 
temperature and precipitation extremes can contribute to 
changes in pathogen transmission, multiplication, and surviv­
ability. More frequent and severe heavy rainfall events can in­
Climate change will influence the fate, 
transport, transmission, viability, and 
multiplication rate of pathogens in the
 food chain.

crease infection risk from most pathogens, particularly when it 
leads to flooding.66 Flooding, and other weather extremes, can 
increase the incidence and levels of pathogens in food produc­
tion, harvesting, and processing environments. Groundwater 
and surface water used for irrigation, harvesting, and washing 
can be contaminated with runoff or flood waters that carry par­
tially or untreated sewage, manure, or other wastes containing 
foodborne contaminants.55, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 The level of Salmonella in 
water is elevated during times of monthly maximum precip­
itation in the summer and fall months;56, 72 consequently the 
likelihood of Salmonella in water may increase in regions expe­
riencing increased total or heavy precipitation events. 
Water is also an important factor in food processing. Climate 
and weather extremes, such as flooding or drought, can reduce 
water quality and increase the risk of pathogen transfer during 
the handling and storage of food following harvest.9 
The direct effect of drought on food safety is less clear. Dry 
conditions can pose a risk for pathogen transmission due to 
reduced water quality, increased risk of runoff when rains 
do occur, and increased pathogen concentration in reduced 
water supplies if such water is used for irrigation, food pro­
cessing, or livestock management.29, 31, 55, 73 Increasing drought 
generally leads to an elevated risk of exposure to pathogens 
such as norovirus and Cryptosporidium.66 However, drought 
and extreme heat events could also decrease the survivability 
of certain foodborne pathogens, affecting establishment and 
transmission, and thus reducing human exposure.66, 74
Mycotoxins and Phycotoxins
Mycotoxins are toxic chemicals produced by molds that grow 
on crops prior to harvest and during storage. Prior to harvest, 
increasing temperatures and drought can stress plants, mak­
ing them more susceptible to mold growth.75 Warm and moist 
conditions favor mold growth directly and affect the biology 
of insect vectors that transmit molds to crops. Post-harvest 
contamination is also affected by environmental parameters, 
including extreme temperatures and moisture. If crops are 
not dried and stored at low humidity, mold growth and myco­
toxin production can increase to very high levels.76, 77 
Phycotoxins are toxic chemicals produced by certain harmful 
freshwater and marine algae that may affect the safety of 
drinking water and shellfish or other seafood. For example, 
the alga responsible for producing ciguatoxin (the toxin that 
causes the illness known as ciguatera fish poisoning) thrives 
in warm water (see also Ch. 6: Water-Related Illness). Pro­
jected increases in sea surface temperatures may expand the 
endemic range of ciguatoxin-producing algae and increase 
ciguatera fish poisoning incidence following ingestion.78 Pre­
dicted increases in sea surface temperature of 4.5° to 6.3°F 
(2.5° to 3.5°C) could yield increases in ciguatera fish poisoning 
cases of 200% to 400%.79 
Crop dusting of a corn field in Iowa.
Climate change will expand the geographical range 
where mold growth and mycotoxin production 
occur.9, 32, 37, 75 Corn, a major U.S. crop, is especially 
susceptible to mold growth and mycotoxin 
production.81 Human dietary exposure to these toxins 
has resulted in illness and death in tropical regions, 
or where their presence remains unregulated.82 In the 
United States, regulations are designed to prevent 
mycotoxins entering the food supply. 
Aflatoxins (naturally occurring mycotoxins found 
in corn) are known carcinogens and can also 
cause impaired development in children, immune 
suppression, and, with severe exposure, death.82, 83, 84 
Recent models show that aflatoxin contamination in 
corn may increase with climate change in Europe.85 
Other commodities susceptible to contamination by 
mycotoxins include peanuts, cereal grains, and fruit.37

Once introduced into the food chain, these poisonous toxins 
can result in adverse health outcomes, with both acute and 
chronic effects. Current regulatory laws and management 
strategies safeguard the food supply from mycotoxins and 
phycotoxins; however, increases in frequency and range of 
their prevalence may increase the vulnerability of the food 
safety system. 
Climate Impacts on Chemical Contaminants 
Climate change will affect human exposure to metals, pesti­
cides, pesticide residues, and other chemical contaminants. 
However, resulting incidence of illness will depend on the 
genetic predisposition of the person exposed, type of contam­
inant, and extent of exposure over time.86
Metals and Other Chemical Contaminants
There are a number of environmental contaminants, such as 
polychlorinated biphenyls, persistent organic pollutants, diox­
ins, pesticides, and heavy metals, which pose a human health 
risk when they enter the food chain. Extreme events may 
facilitate the entry of such contaminants into the food chain, 
particularly during heavy precipitation and flooding.45, 46, 47 For 
example, chemical contaminants in floodwater following Hur­
ricane Katrina included spilled oil, pesticides, heavy metals, 
and hazardous waste.47, 87
Methylmercury is a form of mercury that can be absorbed 
into the bodies of animals, including humans, where it can 
have adverse neurological effects. Elevated water tempera­
tures may lead to higher concentrations of methylmercury in 
fish and mammals.88, 89 This is related to an increase in met­
abolic rates and increased mercury uptake at higher water 
temperatures.28, 90, 91 Human exposure to dietary mercury is 
influenced by the amount of mercury ingested, which can 
vary with the species, age, and size of the fish. If future fish 
consumption patterns are unaltered, increasing ocean tem­
perature would likely increase mercury exposure in human 
diets. Methylmercury exposure can affect the development of 
children, particularly if exposed in utero.92 
Pesticides
Climate change is likely to exhibit a wide range of effects on 
the biology of plant and livestock pests (weeds, insects, and 
microbes). Rising minimum winter temperatures and longer 
growing seasons are very likely to alter pest distribution and 
populations.93, 94, 95 In addition, rising average temperature and 
CO2 concentration are also likely to increase the range and 
distribution of pests, their impact, and the vulnerability of host 
plants and animals.3, 96, 97
Pesticides are chemicals generally regulated for use in agri­
culture to protect plants and animals from pests; chemical 
management is the primary means for agricultural pest control 
in the United States and most developed countries. Because 
climate and CO2 will intensify pest distribution and popula­
tions,98, 99 increases in pesticide use are expected.100, 101 In ad­
dition, the efficacy of chemical management may be reduced 
in the context of climate change. This decline in efficacy can 
reflect CO2-induced increases in the herbicide tolerance of cer­
tain weeds or climate-induced shifts in invasive weed, insect, 
Protein. Protein content of major food crops is very 
likely to decline significantly as atmospheric CO2 
concentrations increase to between 540 and 960 
parts per million (ppm),129, 134, 135, 137 the range 
projected by the end of this century (see description of 
Representative Concentration Pathways in Appendix 1: 
Technical Support Document).14 Current atmospheric 
concentrations of CO2 are approximately 400 ppm.138 
Minerals and trace elements. Rising CO2 levels are very 
likely to lower the concentrations of essential micro- and 
macroelements such as iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, 
copper, sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen in most plants 
(including major cereals and staple crops).16, 128, 132, 133, 
139, 140
Ratio of major macronutrients (carbohydrates to protein). It is very likely that rising CO2 will alter the relative proportions 
of major macronutrients in many crops by increasing carbohydrate content (starch and sugars) while at the same 
time decreasing protein content.16 An increase in dietary carbohydrates-to-protein ratio can have unhealthy effects on 
human metabolism and body mass.136, 141, 142, 143

and plant pathogen populations100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108 as well as 
climate-induced changes that enhance pesticide degradation or 
affect coverage.108, 109 
Increased pest pressures and reductions in the efficacy of pesti­
cides are likely to lead to increased pesticide use, contamination 
in the field, and exposure within the food chain.110 Increased 
exposure to pesticides could have implications for human health.5, 
29, 44 However, the extent of pesticide use and potential exposure 
may also reflect climate change induced choices for crop selection 
and land use.
Pesticide Residues 
Climate change, especially increases in temperature, may be 
important in altering the transmission of vector-borne diseases 
in livestock by influencing the life cycle, range, 
and reproductive success of disease vectors.8, 65 
Potential changes in veterinary practices, including 
an increase in the use of parasiticides and other 
animal health treatments, are likely to be adopt­
ed to maintain livestock health in response to 
climate-induced changes in pests, parasites, and 
microbes.5, 23, 110 This could increase the risk of pes­
ticides entering the food chain or lead to evolution 
of pesticide resistance, with subsequent implica­
tions for the safety, distribution, and consumption 
of livestock and aquaculture products.111, 112, 113
Climate change may affect aquatic animal health 
through temperature-driven increases in dis­
ease.114 The occurrence of increased infections 
in aquaculture with rising temperature has been 
observed for some diseases (such as Ichthyoph­
thirius multifiliis and Flavobacterium columnare)115 
and is likely to result in greater use of aquaculture 
drugs.76 
7.3	 Nutrition
While sufficient quantity of food is an obvious 
requirement for food security, food quality is 
essential to fulfill basic nutritional needs. Globally, 
chronic dietary deficiencies of micronutrients such 
as vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc contribute to 
“hidden hunger,” in which the consequences of the 
micronutrient insufficiency may not be immediate­
ly visible or easily observed. This type of micro­
nutrient deficiency constitutes one of the world’s 
leading health risk factors and adversely affects 
metabolism, the immune system, cognitive devel­
opment and maturation—particularly in children. 
In addition, micronutrient deficiency can exacer­
bate the effects of diseases and can be a factor in 
prevalence of obesity.116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121 
In developed countries with abundant food supplies, like 
the United States, the health burden of malnutrition may 
not be intuitive and is often underappreciated. In the 
United States, although a number of foods are supple­
mented with nutrients, it is estimated that the diets of 
38% and 45% of the population fall below the estimat­
ed average requirements for calcium and magnesium, 
respectively.122 Approximately 12% of the population is at 
risk for zinc deficiency, including perhaps as much as 40% 
of the elderly.123 In addition, nutritional deficiencies of 
magnesium, iron, selenium, and other essential micro­
nutrients can occur in overweight and obese individuals, 
whose diets might reflect excessive intake of calories and 
refined carbohydrates but insufficient intake of vitamins 
and essential minerals.119, 124, 125, 126 
Figure 4: Direct effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) 
on the concentrations of protein and minerals in crops. The top 
figure shows that the rise in CO2 concentration from 293 ppm (at the 
beginning of the last century) to 385 ppm (global average in 2008) 
to 715 ppm (projected to occur by 2100 under the RCP8.5 and 
RCP6.0 pathways),184 progressively lowers protein concentrations in 
wheat flour (the average of four varieties of spring wheat). The lower 
figure—the average effect on 125 plant species and cultivars—
shows that a doubling of CO2 concentration from preindustrial 
levels diminishes the concentration of essential minerals in wild and 
crop plants, including ionome (all the inorganic ions present in an 
organism) levels, and also lowers protein concentrations in barley, 
rice, wheat and potato. (Figure source: Experimental data from Ziska 
et al. 2004 (top figure), Taub et al. 2008, and Loladze 2014 (bottom 
figure)).16, 129, 134

7.4	 Distribution and Access
A reliable and resilient food distribution system is essential 
for access to a safe and nutritious food supply. Access to food 
is characterized by transportation and availability, which are 
defined by infrastructure, trade management, storage re­
quirements, government regulation, and other socioeconomic 
factors.146 
The shift in recent decades to a more global food market 
has resulted in a greater dependency on food transport and 
distribution, particularly for growing urban populations. 
Consequently, any climate-related disturbance to food distri­
bution and transport may have significant impacts not only 
on safety and quality but also on food access. The effects of 
climate change on each of these interfaces will differ based 
on geographic, social, and economic factors.4 Ultimately, the 
outcome of climate-related disruptions and damages to the 
food transportation system will be strongly influenced by the 
resilience of the system, as well as the adaptive capacity of 
individuals, populations, and institutions. 
How Extreme Events Affect Food 
Distribution and Access
Projected increases in the frequency or severity of some 
extreme events will interrupt food delivery, particularly for vul­
nerable transport routes.13, 15, 147, 148 The degree of disruption is 
related to three factors: a) popularity of the transport pathway, 
b) availability of alternate routes, and c) timing or seasonality 
of the extreme event.149 As an example, the food transportation 
system in the United States frequently moves large volumes 
of grain by water. In the case of an extreme weather event 
affecting a waterway, there are few, if any, alternate pathways 
for transport.150 This presents an especially relevant risk to food 
access if an extreme event, like flooding or drought, coincides 
with times of agricultural distribution, such as the fall harvest. 
Immediately following an extreme event, food supply and safe­
ty can be compromised.150, 151, 152 Hurricanes or other storms can 
disrupt food distribution infrastructure, damage food supplies,7 
and limit access to safe and nutritious food, even in areas 
not directly affected by such events (see also Ch. 4: Extreme 
Events).153 For example, the Gulf Coast transportation network 
is vulnerable to storm surges of 23 feet.154 Following Hurricane 
Katrina in 2005, where storm surges of 25 to 28 feet were 
recorded along parts of the Gulf Coast, grain transportation by 
rail or barge was severely slowed due to physical damage to 
infrastructure and the displacement of employees.151, 155 Bar­
riers to food transport may also affect food markets, reaching 
consumers in the form of increased food costs.156 
The risk for food spoilage and contamination in storage facili­
ties, supermarkets, and homes is likely to increase due to the 
impacts of extreme weather events, particularly those that re­
sult in power outages, which may expose food to ambient tem­
How Rising CO2 Affects Nutrition
Though rising CO2 stimulates plant growth and carbohydrate 
production, it reduces the nutritional value (protein and 
minerals) of most food crops (Figure 4).16, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133 
This direct effect of rising CO2 on the nutritional value of crops 
represents a potential threat to human health.16, 133, 134, 135, 136
Protein
As CO2 increases, plants need less protein for photosynthesis, 
resulting in an overall decline in protein concentration in plant 
tissues.134, 135 This trend for declining protein levels is evident for 
wheat flour derived from multiple wheat varieties when grown 
under laboratory conditions simulating the observed increase 
in global atmospheric CO2 concentration since 1900.129 When 
grown at the CO2 levels projected for 2100 (540–958 ppm), ma­
jor food crops, such as barley, wheat, rice, and potato, exhibit 
6% to 15% lower protein concentrations relative to ambient 
levels (315–400 ppm).16, 134, 135 In contrast, protein content is not 
anticipated to decline significantly for corn or sorghum.135
While protein is an essential aspect of human dietary needs, 
the projected human health impacts of a diet including plants 
with reduced protein concentration from increasing CO2 are not 
well understood and may not be of considerable threat in the 
United States, where dietary protein deficiencies are uncom­
mon.
Micronutrients
The ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 is also very likely to 
deplete other elements essential to human health (such as 
calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, and zinc) by 5% to 10% in 
most plants.16 The projected decline in mineral concentrations 
in crops has been attributed to at least two distinct effects of 
elevated CO2 on plant biology. First, rising CO2 increases carbo­
hydrate accumulation in plant tissues, which can, in turn, dilute 
the content of other nutrients, including minerals. Second, high 
CO2 concentrations reduce plant demands for water, resulting 
in fewer nutrients being drawn into plant roots.133, 144, 145
The ongoing increase in CO2 concentrations reduces the 
amount of essential minerals per calorie in most crops, thus 
reducing nutrient density. Such a reduction in crop quality 
may aggravate existing nutritional deficiencies, particularly 
for populations with pre-existing health conditions (see Ch. 9: 
Populations of Concern).
Carbohydrate-to-Protein Ratio
Elevated CO2 tends to increase the concentrations of carbo­
hydrates (starch and sugars) and reduce the concentrations 
of protein.134 The overall effect is a significant increase in the 
ratio of carbohydrates to protein in plants exposed to increas­
ing CO2.16 There is growing evidence that a dietary increase in 
this ratio can adversely affect human metabolism143 and body 
composition.141

peratures inadequate for safe storage.152 Storm-related power 
grid disruptions have steadily increased since 2000.157 Between 
2002 and 2012, extreme weather caused 58% of power outage 
events, 87% of which affected 50,000 or more customers.157 
Power outages are often linked to an increase in illness. For 
example, in August of 2003, a sudden power outage affected 
over 60 million people in the northeastern United States and 
Canada. New York City’s Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene detected a statistically significant citywide increase in 
diarrheal illness resulting from consumption of spoiled foods 
due to lost refrigeration capabilities.158
7.5	 Populations of Concern 
Climate change, combined with other social, economic, and 
political conditions, may increase the vulnerability of many 
different populations to food insecurity or food-related ill­
ness.163 However, not all populations are equally vulnerable.7, 
62 Infants and young children, pregnant women, the elderly, 
low-income populations, agricultural workers, and those with 
weakened immune systems or who have underlying medi­
cal conditions are more susceptible to the effects of climate 
change on food safety, nutrition, and access. 
Children may be especially vulnerable because they eat more 
food by body weight than adults, and do so during important 
stages of physical and mental growth and development. Chil­
dren are also more susceptible to severe infection or compli­
cations from E. coli infections, such as hemolytic uremic syn­
drome.164, 165, 166 Agricultural field workers, especially pesticide 
applicators, may experience increased exposure as pesticide 
applications increase with rising pest loads, which could also 
lead to higher pesticide levels in the children of these field 
workers.167, 168 People living in low-income urban areas, those 
with limited access to supermarkets,169, 170 and the elderly 
may have difficulty accessing safe and nutritious food after 
disruptions associated with extreme weather events. Climate 
change will also affect U.S. Indigenous peoples’ access to both 
wild and cultivated traditional foods associated with their 
nutrition, cultural practices, local economies, and communi­
ty health171 (see also Ch. 6 Water-Related Illness and Ch. 9: 
Populations of Concern). All of the health impacts described 
in this chapter can have significant consequences on mental 
health and well-being (see Ch. 8 Mental Health).
The summer (June through August) of 2012 was the 
second hottest on record for the contiguous United 
States.159 High temperatures and a shortage of rain led 
to one of the most severe summer droughts the nation 
has seen and posed serious impacts to the Mississippi 
River watershed, a major transcontinental shipping route for Midwestern agriculture.160, 161 This drought resulted 
in significant food and economic losses due to reductions in barge traffic, the volume of goods carried, and the 
number of Americans employed by the tugboat industry.162 The 2012 drought was immediately followed by flooding 
throughout the Mississippi in the spring of 2013, which also resulted in disruptions of barge traffic and food 
transport. These swings in precipitation, from drought to flooding, are consistent with projected increases in the 
frequency or severity of some types of extreme weather under continued climate change.7, 62, 152

7.6	 Emerging Issues 
Climate and food allergies. Food allergies in the United States 
currently affect between 1% and 9% of the population,172 but 
have increased significantly among children under age 18 since 
1997.173 Rising CO2 levels can reduce protein content and alter 
protein composition in certain plants, which has the potential 
to alter allergenic sensitivity. For example, rising CO2 has been 
shown to increase the concentration of the Amb a 1 protein—
the allergenic protein most associated with ragweed pollen.174 
However, at present, the question of how rising levels of CO2 
and climate change affect allergenic properties of food is un­
certain and requires more research.175
Heavy metals. Arsenic and other heavy metals occur naturally 
in some groundwater sources.176 Climate change can exacer­
bate drought and competition for water, resulting in the use of 
poorer-quality water sources.177, 178 Because climate and rising 
CO2 levels can also influence the extent of water loss through 
the crop canopy, poorer water quality could lead to changes 
in the concentrations of arsenic and potentially other heavy 
metals (like cadmium and selenium) in plant tissues. Addition­
al information is needed to determine how rising levels of CO2 
and climate change affect heavy metal accumulation in food 
and the consequences for human exposure. 
Zoonosis and livestock. Zoonotic diseases, which are spread 
from animals to humans, can be transmitted through direct 
contact with an infected animal or through the consumption of 
contaminated food or water. Climate change could potentially 
increase the rate of zoonoses, through environmental change 
that alters the biology or evolutionary rate of disease vectors 
or the health of animal hosts. The impact of rising levels of CO2 
and climate change on the transmission of disease through 
zoonosis remains a fundamental issue of potential global 
consequence. 
Foodborne pathogen contamination of fresh produce by insect 
vectors. Climate change will alter the range and distribution of 
insects and other microorganisms that can transmit bacte­
rial pathogens such as Salmonella to fresh produce.179, 180, 181 
Additional information is needed regarding the role of climate 
change on the transmission to and development of food 
pathogens through insect vectors. 
7.7	 Research Needs
In addition to the emerging issues identified above, the 
authors highlight the following potential areas for additional 
scientific and research activity on food safety, nutrition and 
distribution, based on their review of the literature. Under­
standing climate change impacts in the context of the current 
food safety infrastructure will be improved by enhanced 
surveillance of foodborne diseases and contaminant levels, 
improved understanding of CO2 impacts on nutritional quality 
of food, and more accurate models of the impacts of extreme 
events on food access and delivery. 
Future assessments can benefit from research activities that:
•	 synthesize and assess efforts to identify and respond to cur­
rent and projected food safety concerns and their impacts 
on human health within the existing and future food safety 
infrastructure;
•	 develop, test, and expand integrated assessment models 
to enhance understanding of climate and weather vari­
ability, particularly extreme events, and the role of human 
responses, including changes in farming technology and 
management, on health risks within the food chain; and
•	 examine the impacts of rising CO2 and climate change 
on human and livestock nutritional needs, as well as the 
impacts of changing nutritional sources on disease vulner­
ability.1

Supporting Evidence
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING CHAPTER
The chapter was developed through technical discussions 
of relevant evidence and expert deliberation by the report 
authors at several workshops, teleconferences, and email 
exchanges. The authors considered inputs and comments 
submitted by the public, the National Academies of Sciences, 
and Federal agencies. For additional information on the overall 
report process, see Appendices 2 and 3. The author team also 
engaged in targeted consultations during multiple exchanges 
with contributing authors, who provided additional expertise 
on subsets of the Traceable Accounts associated with each Key 
Finding.
Because the impacts of climate change on food production, 
prices, and trade for the United States and globally have 
been widely examined elsewhere, including in the most 
recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 this chapter focuses only on the impacts of 
climate change on food safety, nutrition, and distribution 
in the context of human health in the United States. Many 
nutritional deficiencies and food-related illnesses are of critical 
importance globally, particularly those causing diarrheal 
epidemics or mycotoxin poisoning, and affect U.S. interests 
abroad; but the primary focus of this chapter is to address 
climate impacts on the food safety concerns most important 
in the United States. Thus, the literature cited in this chapter 
is specific to the United States or of demonstrated relevance 
to developed countries. The placement of health threats from 
seafood was determined based on pre- and post-ingestion 
risks: while ingestion of contaminated seafood is discussed 
in this chapter, details on the exposure pathways of water-
related pathogens (for example, through recreational or 
drinking water) are discussed in Chapter 6: Water-Related 
Illness.
KEY FINDING TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS
Increased Risk of Foodborne Illness
Key Finding 1: Climate change, including rising temperatures 
and changes in weather extremes, is expected to increase 
the exposure of food to certain pathogens and toxins [Likely, 
High Confidence]. This will increase the risk of negative health 
impacts [Likely, Medium Confidence], but actual incidence of 
foodborne illness will depend on the efficacy of practices that 
safeguard food in the United States [High Confidence].  
Description of evidence base
Multiple lines of research have shown that changes in weather 
extremes, such as increased extreme precipitation (leading to 
flooding and runoff events), can result in increased microbial 
and chemical contamination of crops and water in agricultural 
environments, with increases in human exposure.55, 56, 72 During 
times of drought, plants become weaker and more susceptible 
to stress, which can result in mold growth and mycotoxin 
production if plants are held in warm, moist environments.32, 75
While studies that link climate change to specific outbreaks 
of foodborne illness are limited, numerous studies have 
documented that many microbial foodborne illnesses increase 
with increasing ambient temperature.18, 19 There is very strong 
evidence that certain bacteria grow more rapidly at higher 
temperatures and can increase the prevalence of pathogens 
and toxins in food.32, 34, 54 Case studies have demonstrated that 
lack of refrigerated storage, particularly during very warm 
weather, leads to increases in microbial growth and higher 
exposure to pathogens.5, 18, 19, 48, 60
Major uncertainties
Concentrations of pathogens and toxins in food are expected to 
increase, resulting in an increase in the risk of human exposure 
to infectious foodborne pathogens and toxins. However, the 
number or severity of foodborne illnesses due to climate change 
is uncertain. Much of this uncertainty is due to having controls 
in place to protect public health. For example, contaminated 
crops are likely to be destroyed before consumption, and 
certain pathogens in food, like mycotoxins, are highly regulated 
in the United States. Consequently, the extent of exposure 
and foodborne illness will depend on regulatory, surveillance, 
monitoring, and communication systems, and on how, and to 
what extent, climate change alters these adaptive capacities. 
Furthermore, for certain pathogens, it is not yet clear whether 
the impact of climate change on a pathogen will be positive 
or negative. For example, climate change could lead to fewer 
cases of norovirus infection in the winter, but worsening health 
outcomes are also possible due to elevated transmission of 
norovirus during floods. Similarly drought can reduce water 
quality, increase runoff, and increase pathogen concentration, 
but can also decrease the survivability of certain foodborne 
pathogens.
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence 
There is high confidence that rising temperature and increases 
in flooding, runoff events, and drought will likely lead to 
increases in the occurrence and transport of pathogens in 
agricultural environments, which will increase the risk of food 
contamination and human exposure to pathogens and toxins. 
However, the actual prevalence of disease will depend on the 
response of regulatory systems and, for certain pathogens, the 
relative importance of multiple climate drivers with opposing 
impacts on exposure. Thus there is medium confidence that 
these impacts of climate change on exposure to pathogens and 
toxins will likely lead to negative health outcomes. There is a 
high confidence that the actual incidence of foodborne illness 
will depend on the efficacy of practices that safeguard food in 
the United States.

Chemical Contaminants in the Food Chain
Key Finding 2: Climate change will increase human 
exposure to chemical contaminants in food through several 
pathways [Likely, Medium Confidence]. Elevated sea surface 
temperatures will lead to greater accumulation of mercury 
in seafood [Likely, Medium Confidence], while increases in 
extreme weather events will introduce contaminants into the 
food chain [Likely, Medium Confidence]. Rising carbon dioxide 
concentrations and climate change will alter incidence and 
distribution of pests, parasites, and microbes [Very Likely, 
High Confidence], leading to increases in the use of pesticides 
and veterinary drugs [Likely, Medium Confidence].
Description of evidence base
There are a number of established pathways by which 
climate change will intensify chemical contaminants within 
the food chain. Multiple studies have shown that increases 
in ocean temperatures are likely to increase the potential 
for mercury exposure, likely due to the increased uptake 
and concentration of mercury in fish and mammals at 
higher metabolic rates associated with warmer ambient 
temperatures.28, 88, 89, 90 Another pathway includes extreme 
weather events, which can move chemical contaminants 
such as lead into agricultural fields and pastures (as well as 
into drinking or recreational water sources—see Chapter 6: 
Water-Related Illness).45, 46, 87 A final pathway is through rising 
minimum winter temperatures and longer growing seasons, 
which will very likely alter pest distribution and populations. 
A large body of literature shows that temperature, carbon 
dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and water availability are also 
likely to affect pest development, number of pest generations 
per year, changes in pest range, rate of infestation, and host 
plant and animal susceptibility.3, 50, 76, 96, 97 Empirical models 
and an analysis of long-term in situ data indicate that rising 
temperatures will result in increased pest pressures.100, 101, 
105 These changes are expected to result in increased use 
of pesticides,100, 102 which can lead to increased human 
exposure.86
Major uncertainties
Each of the pathways described in the evidence base has 
variable levels of uncertainty associated with each step of 
the exposure pathway.110 For all these pathways, projecting 
the specific consequences on human health in the Unites 
States is challenging, due to the variability in type of pathogen 
or contaminant, time and duration of exposures, individual 
sensitivity (for example, genetic predisposition) and individual 
or institutional adaptive capacity. While increasing exposure 
to chemicals will exacerbate potential health risks, the nature 
of those risks will depend on the specific epidemiological links 
between exposure and human health as well as availability 
and access to health services. Resulting incidence of illness will 
depend on the genetic predisposition of the person exposed, 
type of contaminant, and extent of exposure over time.86
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence 
Although it is likely that climate change will increase human 
exposure to chemical contaminants, the specific pathway(s) 
of exposure have varying levels of uncertainty associated 
with them and hence there is medium confidence regarding 
the overall extent of exposure. This chapter focuses on three 
such pathways. First, it is likely that elevated sea surface 
temperatures will result in increased bioaccumulation 
of mercury in seafood, but there is medium confidence 
regarding human illness because rates of accumulation and 
exposure vary according to the type of seafood ingested, 
and because of the role of varying individual sensitivity and 
individual or institutional adaptive capacity (particularly 
behavioral choices). Similarly, it is likely that extreme events 
will increase contaminants into agricultural soil and the 
food chain. However, there is medium confidence regarding 
exposure because the specific nature of the contaminant 
and the food source will vary, and because the extent of 
exposure will depend on risk management, communication 
of public health threats, and the effectiveness of regulatory, 
surveillance, and monitoring systems within the current food 
safety network. There is high confidence that it is very likely 
that rising CO2 and climate change will alter pest incidence 
and distribution. There is medium confidence that such 
changes in incidence and distribution are likely to increase 
chemical management and the use of veterinary drugs 
in livestock. However, in all these pathways, the specific 
consequences on human health in the Unites States are 
uncertain, due primarily to the variability in type of pathogen 
or contaminant, time and duration of exposures, individual 
sensitivity (for example, genetic predisposition), and 
individual or institutional adaptive capacity. 
Rising Carbon Dioxide Lowers Nutritional Value of Food
Key Finding 3: The nutritional value of agriculturally 
important food crops, such as wheat and rice, will decrease 
as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide continue to 
reduce the concentrations of protein and essential minerals in 
most plant species [Very Likely, High Confidence].
Description of evidence base
The nutritional response of crops to rising carbon dioxide is 
well documented, particularly among C3 cereals such as rice 
and wheat, which make up the bulk of human caloric input. C3 
species are about 95% of all plant species and represent those 
species most likely to respond to an increase in atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations.
There is strong evidence and consensus that protein 
concentrations in plants strongly correlate with nitrogen 
concentrations. CO2-induced declines in nitrogen 
concentrations have been observed in nearly a hundred 
individual studies and several meta-analyses.16, 133, 137, 139, 140 A 
meta-analysis of the effect of CO2 on protein by crop covers 

7–FOOD SAFETY, NUTRITION, AND DISTRIBUTION
U.S. Global Change Research Program
Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States
204
228 observations on wheat, rice, soybeans, barley and potato, 
134 and was recently repeated for the United States, Japan, 
and Australia,135 covering 138 mean observations on nitrogen/
protein in wheat, rice, peas, maize, and sorghum. There is very 
strong evidence that rising CO2 reduces protein content in non-
leguminous C3 crops, including wheat, rice, potato, and barley. 
There is also good agreement across studies that the ongoing 
increase in CO2 elevates the overall carbohydrate content in C3 
plants.16 
Another meta-analysis quantifies the role of increasing CO2 in 
altering the ionome (the mineral nutrient and trace element 
composition of an organism) of plants, including major 
crops.16 This meta-analysis of 7,761 observations indicates 
that increasing CO2 also significantly reduces the mineral 
concentrations (calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, sulfur, 
potassium, and phosphorus) in C3 plants, including grains and 
edible parts of other crops, while also substantially increasing 
the ratio of total non-structural carbohydrates (starch and 
sugars) to minerals and to protein.
Furthermore, these studies show the quality of current crops 
to be lower relative to the crops raised in the past with respect 
to protein and minerals.16, 134 Direct experimental evidence 
shows that protein concentrations in wheat flour progressively 
declined with rising CO2 concentrations representing levels 
in 1900 (approximately 290 ppm),  2008 (approximately 385 
ppm), and the CO2 concentrations projected to occur later in 
this century (approximately 715 ppm).129
Major uncertainties
While the general response and the direction in the change 
of crop quality is evident; there is uncertainty in the extent of 
variation in both protein and ionome among different crop 
varieties. There is little evidence regarding the CO2 effects 
on complex micronutrients such as carotenoids (vitamin A, 
lutein, and zeaxanthin). Although protein, micronutrients, and 
ratio of carbohydrates to protein are all essential aspects of 
human dietary needs, the projected human health impacts 
of nutritional changes with increasing CO2 are still being 
evaluated. There remains a high level of uncertainty regarding 
how reductions in crop quality affect human nutrition 
by contributing to or aggravating existing chronic dietary 
deficiencies and obesity risks, particularly in the United States 
where dietary protein deficiencies are uncommon.
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
Based on the evidence, there is high confidence that the 
rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 has resulted in a reduction 
in the level of protein and minerals relative to the amount of 
carbohydrates present for a number of important crop species 
(including a number of globally important cereals such as 
wheat, barley and rice), and will very likely continue to do so as 
atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise. 
Extreme Weather Limits Access to Safe Foods
Key Finding 4: Increases in the frequency or intensity of some 
extreme weather events associated with climate change 
will increase disruptions of food distribution by damaging 
existing infrastructure or slowing food shipments [Likely, 
High Confidence]. These impediments lead to increased risk 
for food damage, spoilage, or contamination, which will 
limit availability of and access to safe and nutritious food, 
depending on the extent of disruption and the resilience of 
food distribution infrastructure [Medium Confidence].
Description of evidence base
It is well documented in assessment literature that climate 
models project an increase in the frequency and intensity 
of some extreme weather events.14, 15 Because the food 
transportation system moves large volumes at a time, 
has limited alternative routes, and is dependent on the 
timing of the growing and harvest seasons, it is likely that 
the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events13, 14 will also increase the frequency 
of food supply chain disruptions (including risks to food 
availability and access)147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 156 and the risk for 
food spoilage and contamination.152, 163 Recent extreme 
events have demonstrated a clear linkage to the disruption 
of food distribution and access.151, 161 Case studies show 
that such events, particularly those that result in power 
outages, may also expose food to temperatures inadequate 
for safe storage,152 with increased risk of illness. For example, 
New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 
detected a statistically significant citywide increase in 
diarrheal illness resulting from consumption of spoiled foods 
due to lost refrigeration capabilities after a 2003 power 
outage.158
Major uncertainties
The extent to which climate-related disruptions to the food 
distribution system will affect food supply, safety, and human 
health, including incidences of illnesses, remains uncertain. 
This is because the impacts of any one extreme weather 
event are determined by the type, severity, and intensity 
of the event, the geographic location in which it occurs, 
infrastructure resiliency, and the social vulnerabilities or 
adaptive capacity of the populations at risk.
Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence
Given the evidence base and current uncertainties, there is 
high confidence that projected increases in the frequency 
and severity of extreme events will likely lead to damage of 
existing food supplies and disruptions to food distribution 
infrastructure. There is medium confidence that these 
damages and disruptions will increase risk for food damage, 
spoilage, or contamination, which will limit availability and 
access to safe and nutritious foods because of uncertainties 
surrounding the extent of the disruptions and individual, 
community, or institutional sensitivity to impacts. There are 

7–FOOD SAFETY, NUTRITION, AND DISTRIBUTION

205
further uncertainties surrounding how the specific dynamics of 
the extreme event, such as the geographic location in which it 
occurs, as well as the social vulnerabilities or adaptive capacity 
of the populations at risk, will impact human health.
