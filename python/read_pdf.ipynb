      "and our interactions with the built and natural environments. \n",
      "As the climate continues to change, the risks to human health \n",

      "States, we have observed climate-related increases in our \n",
      "exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or \n",
      "longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases \n",

      "is adapted from its use in chemical risk assessment, and in this \n",

      "that cause illness. Water-related illnesses include waterborne \n",
      "diseases caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and \n",
      "protozoa. Water-related illnesses are also caused by toxins \n",
      "produced by certain harmful algae and cyanobacteria (also \n",
      "known as blue-green algae) and by chemicals introduced \n",
      "into the environment by human activities.  Exposure occurs \n",
      "through ingestion, inhalation, or direct contact with contami­\n",
      "nated drinking or recreational water and through consumption \n",
      "of fish and shellfish. \n",

      "crops are likely to be destroyed before consumption, and \n",
      "certain pathogens in food, like mycotoxins, are highly regulated \n",
      "in the United States. Consequently, the extent of exposure \n",

      "Furthermore, for certain pathogens, it is not yet clear whether \n",

      "population groups in the United States. The vulnerability \n",
      "of any given group is a function of its sensitivity to climate \n",
      "change related health risks, its exposure to those risks, and its \n",
      "capacity for responding to or coping with climate variability \n",
      "and change. Vulnerable groups of people, described here as \n",
      "populations of concern, include those with low income, some \n",
      "communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with \n",
      "limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children \n",
      "and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational \n",
      "groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting \n",

      "ficials, politicians and physicians, scientists and social service \n",

      "complex risks to their health and well-being in response to \n",
      "climate change. \n",

      "in impoverished urban or isolated rural areas, floodplains, \n",
      "coastlines, and other at-risk locations are more vulnerable not \n",
      "only to extreme weather and persistent climate change but \n",

      "vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. The \n",
      "definitions of the following key concepts are important to \n",
      "understand how some people or communities are dispropor­\n",

      "Definitions are adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel \n",
      "on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Research Council \n",
      "(NRC).2, 3\n",
      "•\t Vulnerability is the tendency or predisposition to be \n",
      "adversely affected by climate-related health effects, and \n",
      "encompasses three elements: exposure, sensitivity or sus­\n",
      "ceptibility to harm, and the capacity to adapt to or to cope \n",
      "with change. Exposure is contact between a person and one \n",
      "or more biological, chemical, or physical stressors, including \n",
      "stressors affected by climate change. Contact may occur in \n",
      "a single instance or repeatedly over time, and may occur in \n",
      "one location or over a wider geographic area. Sensitivity is \n",
      "the degree to which people or communities are affected, \n",
      "either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability and \n",
      "change. Adaptive capacity is the ability of communities, \n",
      "institutions, or people to adjust to potential hazards, to take \n",
      "advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences. \n",
      "A related term, resilience, is the ability to prepare and plan \n",
      "for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to \n",
      "adverse events. People and communities with strong adap­\n",

      "illness across different regions and seasons; these relation­\n",
      "ships vary based on average temperatures in those locations \n",
      "and the timing of the heat or cold event. For example, a 95°F \n",
      "day in Vermont will have different implications for health \n",

      "Multiple lines of research have shown that changes in weather \n",
      "extremes, such as increased extreme precipitation (leading to \n",
      "flooding and runoff events), can result in increased microbial \n",
      "and chemical contamination of crops and water in agricultural \n",

      "While studies that link climate change to specific outbreaks \n",
      "of foodborne illness are limited, numerous studies have \n",
      "documented that many microbial foodborne illnesses increase \n",
      "with increasing ambient temperature.18, 19 There is very strong \n",
      "evidence that certain bacteria grow more rapidly at higher \n",
      "temperatures and can increase the prevalence of pathogens \n",
      "and toxins in food.32, 34, 54 Case studies have demonstrated that \n",
      "lack of refrigerated storage, particularly during very warm \n",
      "weather, leads to increases in microbial growth and higher \n",
      "exposure to pathogens.5, 18, 19, 48, 60\n",
      "Major uncertainties\n",
      "Concentrations of pathogens and toxins in food are expected to \n",

      "to infectious foodborne pathogens and toxins. However, the \n",
      "number or severity of foodborne illnesses due to climate change \n",
      "is uncertain. Much of this uncertainty is due to having controls \n",
      "in place to protect public health. For example, contaminated \n",
      "crops are likely to be destroyed before consumption, and \n",
      "certain pathogens in food, like mycotoxins, are highly regulated \n",
      "in the United States. Consequently, the extent of exposure \n",
      "and foodborne illness will depend on regulatory, surveillance, \n",
      "monitoring, and communication systems, and on how, and to \n",
      "what extent, climate change alters these adaptive capacities. \n",
      "Furthermore, for certain pathogens, it is not yet clear whether \n",
      "the impact of climate change on a pathogen will be positive \n",
      "or negative. For example, climate change could lead to fewer \n",
      "cases of norovirus infection in the winter, but worsening health \n",
      "outcomes are also possible due to elevated transmission of \n",
      "norovirus during floods. Similarly drought can reduce water \n",
      "quality, increase runoff, and increase pathogen concentration, \n",
      "but can also decrease the survivability of certain foodborne \n",
      "pathogens.\n",
      "Assessment of confidence and likelihood based on evidence \n",
      "There is high confidence that rising temperature and increases \n",
      "in flooding, runoff events, and drought will likely lead to \n",
      "increases in the occurrence and transport of pathogens in \n",
      "agricultural environments, which will increase the risk of food \n",
